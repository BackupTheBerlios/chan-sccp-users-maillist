<PRE>Hi,

we have quite the same as Sebastian. We are using asterisk 1.4 including
patched chan_sccp driver. 30 x Cisco 7960, 5 x 7912 and 5 DECT Kirk phones.
We are using two LANCOM 1724 for bridging ISDN calls to SIP and separating
incoming Faxes. We have two sights where we have trunked the asterisk
servers. Also we are using an asterisk in our DMZ as SIP Proxy.

It is working quite well. Also PARK and PICKUP functions are included. The
only problem we have is the transfer via embedded Key functions. There is a
constalation when someone trys to transfer, but the other partner does not
pickup the phone. The whole asterisk is crashing. Therfore we are using the
asterisk transfer methods and disabled the key for transfer on the phones.

I fully agree, it is a pitty that no development on chan_sccp is done. Also
thet asterisk developers do not push skinny channel driver to the nivaue of
sccp. But .. as I said, it works quite well. 

We are using asterisk now for more then 7 month. We do approx. 3.000
external calls (incoming/outgoing) per month. I don&#180;t count the internal
calls.

Every outgoing call (except Fax) is routed to a SIP provider. This saves
costs monthly approx. 300 &#8364;, due to VOIP flatrates. Also the investment of a
new telephone central like Tenovis, Siemens could be bounded to &quot;only&quot;
18.000 &#8364;. Which is for a standard telephone central for 5 year rental
approx. 50.000 &#8364; in our case. So you save 30.000 &#8364; in investment.

These are nice figures. In this case we are quite happy with this solution
and we haope that we can stay more then 5 years on the system.

Betreff: Re: [Chan-sccp-users] I've finally had to give up with chan_sccp

Hi Martin,

we are using almost two years Asterisk 1.2.x and chan_sccp-20060408 + 2
patches
with 21 Cisco 7960 + one 7961 phones.

I have build our chan_sccp version with the following create_config.sh
options:

- without PARK functions
- with    PICKUP

Transfer, gpickup, meetme and queues works to 99,8 percent fine. Rarely the
asterisk
crashes. With an workaround-script to restart the asterisk is up again after
20 seconds
with all phones.

Which arch is your asterisk server? We supports different asterisks and have
problems
on x86_64 Systems. On i686 it works fine.


Regards,

Sebastian
