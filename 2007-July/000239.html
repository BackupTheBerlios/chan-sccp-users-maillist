<PRE>Dear list members,

A while back I remember someone saying that Group pickup was related to parking and I just read another message on a similar motion. Unless I have completely missed the point, these are two very different things. Group pickup allows you to answer a call that is not actually ringing on your handset provided that your extension is an admin of a pickup group that contains an extension that is ringing - this facility is mostly provided within the channel driver - I am not sure if it works between channel drivers. 

Parking is an Asterisk feature that allow an active call to be moved to a virtual extension and then moved back to another real extension. This is used where a caller wants to hold for someone rather than use voicemail and allows the initial call handler to &quot;detach&quot; from the call. Paging is often used to alert the recipient that a call is parked for them. The call will however come back to the call handler after a specified amount of time.

As I understand, chan_sccp handles group pickup but does not get involved in parking calls or getting calls from a call park.

Please could more knowledgeable members agree or deny the above.

Regards,

Martin
