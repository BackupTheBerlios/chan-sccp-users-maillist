<PRE>Dear list members,
 
After a year of struggling for a year in an office with 24 Cisco 7940s/chan_sccp-20060408 + 2 patches/Asterisk 1.2.x, I've finally had to convert the phones to SIP. I really didn't want to do this but even with the latest Asterisk 1.2.x I was getting messages about deadlocks being avoided and the whole system ceasing to work until re-boot. The problems are always connected with transferring calls.
 
I was using P00307020400 firmware on the handsets, Asterisk 1.2.18, chan_sccp-20060408 + 2 patches. Perhaps I should have changed the protocolversion in sccp.conf, but there is a limit to how much messing around you can do in a live office environment.
 
Changing to SIP has had some real downsides. Instead of using Cisco 9714s, I now have to buy Polycom IP601 phones + sidecars, blind transfers seem to result in dead silence, sometimes phones don't seem to know when the other end has hung up etc.
 
Is there anyone out there still using Asterisk 1.2.x with chan_sccp in a typical environment where incoming calls are answered by one or two people and then transferred as needed?
 
Unless I am mistaken, all development of chan_sccp has been aimed at compatability with Asterisk 1.4.x and the forum is now in german which I find hard to understand.
 
Thank you for all your comments.
 
Martin
