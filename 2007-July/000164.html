<PRE>It's a shame.  The possibilities with Skinny was so much more than
what SIP has to offer.  How many professional PBX's cannot change the
caller ID information after a call has been transferred to show who
the user is actually now talking to?

Such will be the case for a long time with Asterisk using SIP.  This
could have been done using Skinny.

That's just one of the many things...

</I>&gt;<i> After a year of struggling for a year in an office with 24 Cisco

</I>&gt;<i> I was using P00307020400 firmware on the handsets, Asterisk 1.2.18,

</I>&gt;<i> protocolversion in sccp.conf, but there is a limit to how much messing

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Changing to SIP has had some real downsides. Instead of using Cisco 9714s, I

</I>&gt;<i> end has hung up etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there anyone out there still using Asterisk 1.2.x with chan_sccp in a
</I>&gt;<i> typical environment where incoming calls are answered by one or two people
</I>&gt;<i> and then transferred as needed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unless I am mistaken, all development of chan_sccp has been aimed at
</I>&gt;<i> compatability with Asterisk 1.4.x and the forum is now in german which I
</I>&gt;<i> find hard to understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for all your comments.
