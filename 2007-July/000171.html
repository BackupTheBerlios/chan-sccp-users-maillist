<PRE>Dear list members,

It is interesting to hear that another member has had problems running Asterisk/chan_sccp on 64 bit. I was using Suse 10.1 on IA64 with Asterisk 1.2.5 for a year and had to create a cron job that checked if the Asterisk process was still running and re-started it every minute. I also added another cron job to re-boot the server every night. Sometimes it would crash three times a day, but the users have managed to cope.

A couple of weeks ago, I setup a new system using CentOS Server 4.5 (i386) with the latest Asterisk 1.2.x and this time I started getting deadlock problems. Using a cron job to re-start didn't seem to work because the Asterisk process continued to be stuck in memory. The users had to re-boot the server manually!

I really wish that I had the skills to check the chan_sccp code, but luckily it looks like Federico has manged to do this. I will certainly test these fixes if he is kind enough to let me and will report back.


Regards,

Martin
