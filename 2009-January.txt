Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] chan-sccp-b realtime support?
Message-ID: <db755ed60901280954h28477e5epc668f6f14799b2ff@mail.gmail.com>

I'm attempting to setup an environment where I can plug in a 7960 and
have asterisk automatically accept it's registration. I know this is
possible with sip, but I want to use sccp. I found a previous realtime
patch for an old version of chan-sccp. Has this feature been glossed
over in chan-sccp-b? Is there a more elegant way to be doing this?
Thanks!

Hi,

sccp realtime support is present in chan-sccp.

I suggest you use the v3 branch from svn.

For details on how to setup your tables, please contact me again, I  
have it all running in my deployment environment.

CU,
-David.
