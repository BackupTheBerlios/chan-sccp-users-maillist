<PRE>Hi David,

2007/1/6, David Dederscheck &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/chan-sccp-users">davidded at davidded.de</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> well, if your patch works fine, this sounds very promising. Go and
</I>&gt;<i> collect your bounty ;-)
</I>

yup, as soon as i have his account-id, he's getting paid, i've already
contacted him ;-)


But seriously, we should test your patch and once its stability


Agreed. I've allready done 10 calls with it, all the basic functions work,
with some minor problems:

- compile with PARK=y fails
- Pickup does not work even if compiled in (the Softkey does not show up)
- Setting an _alert-info does not work at all

Can someone confirm this? The last might be some other change in
asterisk...?


confirmed, contact Sergio about how to proceed integrating the code
&gt;<i> with the berlios svn and opening another branch for 1.4. We'd
</I>&gt;<i> probably also want to merge the few but important fixes against the
</I>&gt;<i> latest chan_sccp to the svn.
</I>

I have no idea who really has access to the sourceforge-svn,
but it would be great if this person could give commit access to anyone
who want's it, currently someone that wants to use chan_sccp with asterisk
1.4 need's to be able to do svn checkouts and apply various patches, thats
way to complicated for many...

sergio clearly stated that he don't want to use a public svn/cvs repository,
so
i guess we won't get any help from him anyway...


I understand that Sergio hasn't had much time for chan_sccp as of
&gt;<i> late, and it might be possible that he wouldn't want to manage the
</I>&gt;<i> project any longer. Does anybody know something more specific about
</I>&gt;<i> his current state?
</I>

well, IMHO thats the whole problem. Noone knows what he's up to, and he
'aint tellin' :-(


I would be willing to continue the project administration or at least
&gt;<i> help Sergio, and I would be happy about anybody working towards the
</I>&gt;<i> same end joining me in that effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

At least we now have a version that basicly works with asterisk 1.4, i'm
sure the small
problems i described will be corrected by someone in time. If you want to
take the lead,
just go for it :-D

Executive Summary: :-D It's alive (again)! :-D


Regards,

Jay.
