<PRE>Hi,

I have a working chan_sccp with Asterisk 1.4.0. I have posted my patch
is posted at <A HREF="https://developer.berlios.de/patch/index.php.">https://developer.berlios.de/patch/index.php.</A>  It is
against the svn (which is why it is such a small patch :). I only have a
limited setup to test against, so please beware, but so far so good :)

As for why?  Well me, I want more integration with the other channels
(gtalk etc).., so 1.4.0 is a natural progression and have the ability to
break this one :)
If it was prod I would probably hold off. 

Oh, and I went to chan_skinny initially with 1.4.0, but didn't want to
spend time converting the configs. (too lazy?)

Regards

David



Hi,

 

we are using chan_sccp with * 1.2.14, 35 Cisco phones and it works quite
well. Why should we change to Asterisk 1.4. I can not find any reason at
this time. Awaiting that chan_skinny is developing with all the features of
chan_sccp is the most common way for us. 

 

Can someone explain the main difference between both Asterisk versions? We
are likely to support the chan_sccp as well as the chan_skinny solution, but
it has to work. 
 and even more the code should under GPL afterwards.

 

We are also a German company and paying via Paypal is not the problem, but
getting an invoice :-)

 

Have a nice day, 

 

Awaiting your comments

 

Marcus

Hi

we, the SEC-u-DIS GmbH (Germany), will support this LAST attempt to keep/get
SCCP alive for the community and us.

Thus, we will DOUBLE Jay&#180;s bountys by  offering additional honeypots:

For solution 1): 100 USD

For solution 2): 500 USD (OUR PREFERENCE)

Conditions: As mentioned by Jay!

Hi

in a last attempt to get a working, usable SCCP channel for asterisk 1.4,
i'm offering two bountys:


1. $100 USD (PayPal)

- patch against chan_sccp 20060408
- GPL (obviously)


2. $500 USD (PayPal) 

- patch against chan_skinny from asterisk 1.4
- properly disclamed to digium for inclusion in the official asterisk svn
- includes all features of chan_sccp


The first one should be pretty easy, the loader work has already been done
and is available at
<A HREF="https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pbxcc/modules/chan_sccp,">https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pbxcc/modules/chan_sccp,</A> so it's just
the rtp stuff that has to be done. I guess a look at how the changes where
done to chan_skinny would help. Bounty can be collected after i've done the
first successfull call (without crash ;-)). 

The second one will be much harder, you more-or-less have to rebuild all
features from scratch, based on chan_skinny. Technically, i dont care how it
is done, if someone can convince/bribe Sergio to disclame his patches you
can safe a lot of time and work. Bounty can be collected after inclusion in
the digium svn with all features of chan_sccp. 

If you wish to collect the second bounty, please contact me in advance.

Jay....
