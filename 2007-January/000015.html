<PRE>I would also be willing to contribute code for future chan_sccp
development.  I had some 1.4BETA patches I was working on, but was
focusing more on native bridged call (conference) functions.  Not
knowing whether to work with the chan_sccp or chan_skinny development
has been (as was stated by previous others) has been a real drag.  I had
pretty much stopped writing code until either some clear direction
emerged.

I would love to get this work incorporated into the asterisk dev
project, but I assume the same issues would bite whomever takes over the
project (i.e. multiple past contributors = disclaimer difficulty).

Sincerely,

Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] chan_sccp and asterisk 1.4.0

Hi David,

I would be willing to help on some of the contributions, esp towards  
having this working with 1.4. Whilst there are tons of C developers  
out there who would love to contribute, its the politics and overhead  
that puts people off. If you, or someone, sets up another branch of  
chan_sccp for 1.4.0 then count me in as well. I have the setup to  
hand as well as an asterisk 'expert'.

Best Regards
Anthony
