Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] Can't Install Asterisk SCCP channel driver?
Message-ID: <01cd01c75b76$df060250$9d1206f0$@gov>

I am having problems try to install the Asterisk SCCP channel driver.  I
used majority of the

steps posted on http://chan-sccp.berlios.de

 

wget ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/chan-sccp/chan_sccp-20060408.tar.bz2

tar xvjf chan_sccp-20060408.tar.bz2

cd chan_sccp-20060408

make clean

make install

 

 

Doing a "make install" I get the following error & messages (I tried yes and
no for Build PARK and PICKUP functions):

 

[root at rhel01tra chan_sccp-20060408]# make install

sh ./create_config.sh "/usr/include"

Checking Asterisk version...

My question .... is there any additional step(s) that need to be done,
install, or configured to get this going?  

 

Any help and suggestions with this would be very grateful? 

 

Thanks in advanced

BTW - I'm running Asterisk 1.4.0 and Linux kernel 2.6

Chan_sccp isn't compatible with Asterisk 1.4.
