do you mean the latest berlios release for 1.2 or the latest post on  
this list?

&gt;<i> - I nearly lost my biggest customer yesterday over phone system

</I>&gt;<i> confident of applying patches. What reason (perhaps only time) that  
</I>&gt;<i> the current tree can not be released?
</I>
Well, of course it bails down to time. However, Marcello and I have  
agreed that our initial release shall compile with both asterisk 1.2  
and 1.4 so that future patches will only have to be applied against  
one tree. Apart from that we're ready for a release.

Beyond that we're still waiting for input by all the other commited  
people who have created other versions of chan_sccp, especially those  
working with asterisk 1.4. As we created a fork of the berlios  
chan_sccp to bring this work forward, we don't want it merely to be  
based on &quot;our stuff&quot; because we started it.

So on this occasion again: Please submit your patches or tell about  
your custom version of chan_sccp. We really with to re-unite all the  
useful however &quot;stray&quot; patches and pieces of code out there. I know  
how much work it is to actually identify the changes entered  
quick&amp;dirty into one's own source tree, but it's definitely worth it.

Attached to this mail is the most recent version of Marcello's and  
mine joint work. I just added a feature that I had to unravel from my  
own legacy 1.2 tree: Using the global option &quot;recorddigittimeoutchar  
= on&quot;, the '#' to terminate variable-length numbers as they commonly  
occur in European countries, is recorded to the call logs if it was  
dialed at first. So redialing works without manual post-dialing the #  
from the logs.

&gt;<i> Phone firmware versions - Any chance we can get agreement on the  
</I>&gt;<i> best firmware versions for the various models?
</I>
I have found that firmware version 7.2.2 works quite stable for the  
7940 and 7960. Although the 8.0.4 version seems to be stable too, I  
did not see a noticeable benefit in using this version. Please  
correct me if I missed an important issue.

Apart from that the most recent versions should be allright since we  
solved the directories issues. If you get any trouble nevertheless,  
just ask to the list what version is &quot;known good&quot; to the others members.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DST/locale settings - Can anyone explain what files are needed to  
</I>&gt;<i> correctly localise Cisco phone 7940/7941/7960/7961 etc. During UK  
</I>&gt;<i> DST time all my 7940/7960 phones showed the correct time and my  
</I>&gt;<i> 7961 phone was 1 hour out. Now that DST has ended, all my  
</I>&gt;<i> 7940/7960s are 1 hour out and 7961 is correct! I would like my 7961  
</I>&gt;<i> to show the date in UK format eg. d/m/y as my 7940/7960 already do  
</I>&gt;<i> (taken from sccp.conf). I know that there was a change in the way  
</I>&gt;<i> locale settings are used between 7940/7960 series and 7941/7961  
</I>&gt;<i> series. I have access to Cisco downloads.
</I>
AFAIK the 7940/60s don't get the timezone information whatsoever.  
They just display the local time of the asterisk server, don't they?  
So you should check your server for that issue.

The 7941/61/70s all use the following settings for the timezone/ 
display issue:

     &lt;dateTimeSetting&gt;
         &lt;name&gt;CMLocal&lt;/name&gt;
         &lt;dateTemplate&gt;D.M.Y&lt;/dateTemplate&gt;
         &lt;timeZone&gt;W. Europe Standard/Daylight Time&lt;/timeZone&gt;
     &lt;/dateTimeSetting&gt;

Insert this just with a valid timezone string insted of W. Europe...  
before the &lt;callManagerGroup&gt; tag of your xml config. At the end of  
this mail I have compiled a list of valid timezone entries from the  
simplevoip wiki at <A HREF="http://voip-info.simplevoip.info/wiki/">http://voip-info.simplevoip.info/wiki/</A>

&gt;<i> Caller id when transferring calls - I have also noticed that  
</I>&gt;<i> incoming caller id is lost when a call is transferred (assisted  
</I>&gt;<i> transfer). My users would expect to see the details of the original  
</I>&gt;<i> caller after the incoming call has been connected. I always thought  
</I>&gt;<i> that this was one of the benefits of the sccp that the PBX can re- 
</I>&gt;<i> write the display as necessary and thus change the info displayed?
</I>
Yes, but it also has to be implemented correctly, which was not so  
easy at the time Sergio had to do it. He commented on that issue just  
recently on the list. But I'm convinced that it's possible and not a  
great deal of work to get the feature working as you request it.

&gt;<i> Cisco router with CME 4 available - I am happy to donate a Cisco  
</I>&gt;<i> 1721 router complete with CME 4 to anyone who can really use it to  
</I>&gt;<i> further the cause of integration. This does list models 7941/7961  
</I>&gt;<i> etc. I am happy to send this via courier to anywhere in Europe. I  
</I>&gt;<i> purchased this to debug how the lights on 7914s are controlled to  
</I>&gt;<i> allow more functionality in chan_sccp, but will propbably never get  
</I>&gt;<i> the time to do this.
</I>
In fact, it would be very helpful to have such a router available to  
get forward with the newer protocol versions and more advanced  
features, which includes distinctive ringing, feature buttons,  
conference calls and shared lines. We have observed that minor things  
like the order of messages being sent can be important, which cannot  
always be guessed easily.

As Marcello and I currently don't have a CallManager at hand, and  
also lack IT administrator friends who occasionally might record a  
network trace, we could really use it to get on with the new  
features. We would be very grateful to accept your offer.


&gt;<i> UK PRI/ISDN30 settings - Is there anyone else in the UK using  
</I>&gt;<i> Digium E1 cards with PRI/ISDN30 lines? I have had a recent issue  
</I>&gt;<i> with one customer where customers ringing in were getting a busy  
</I>&gt;<i> signal and yet Asterisk/Zaptel showed no issues. I guess I need to  
</I>&gt;<i> debug PRI stuff, but this is fairly complex. I would be interested  
</I>&gt;<i> to know what settings anyone else uses for:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Timing source (I'm sure BT told me that the exchange should always  
</I>&gt;<i> provide the timing source)
</I>&gt;<i> Reset B channels: On or Off
</I>&gt;<i> Distance from NTE
</I>&gt;<i> Echo settings
</I>
I'm not using any PRI cards, but I use bristuff's hfc zaptel drivers  
connected to bri ISDN PSTN. If the E1 card is the only device  
connected to the PRI trunk, which seems like the only common  
configuration one would use, I wouldn't expect such problems though.  
Are you sure the busy signal at the customer's site wasn't due to  
congestion of BT's network?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Martin

Regards,
-David.
