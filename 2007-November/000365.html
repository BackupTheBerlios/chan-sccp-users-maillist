<PRE>David,

Many thanks for your reply to my email.

If you give me your address, then I'll send off the router.

Latest version of chan_sccp - Are you saying that berlios has the latest version for
Asterisk 1.2 and your tree is the latest version for 1.4? I'm getting confused about
this. I appreciate that you want to have one tree for 1.2/1.4 which is a good thing, 
but I'll take your source as a 1.4 only solution at the moment. Which fixes do you
think are missing from your tree?

My contribution recently submitted was a fix for the 7960+7914 lost hangup event
after a re-dial/invalid extension, but it sounds like no one else has had this problem?

Can anyone recommend firmware versions for 7941/7961 (fairly hard to work out what the
version number is from the filenames!). As you say, there seems to be little point in using
the latest firmware unless you are actually working with Call Manager.

Timezones - My server's clock is on UTC/GMT and correctly changes the local time for DST.
As you say, I thought 7940/7960s just take the local time via sccp and also take the date
format from sccp messages. The 7941/7961/7970/7971 etc seem to pay more attention to the
config files. I'll try specifying the correct time zone in the config files as you suggest.

Regards,

Martin
