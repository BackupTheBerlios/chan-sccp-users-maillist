<PRE>Hallo David,
hallo Martin,

we are very happy with the latest version. We added the transfer and the
group pickup fix and all our problems seem to disappear. 

Even if there are some minor issues I agree that this version of chan_sccp
is no longer a release candidate. It is a release!

Thanks a lot for this great work especially to David, Mardello and of course
the father of chan_sccp Sergio.

Have a nice day.

do you mean the latest berlios release for 1.2 or the latest post on

Well, of course it bails down to time. However, Marcello and I have  
agreed that our initial release shall compile with both asterisk 1.2  
and 1.4 so that future patches will only have to be applied against  
one tree. Apart from that we're ready for a release.

Beyond that we're still waiting for input by all the other commited  
people who have created other versions of chan_sccp, especially those  
working with asterisk 1.4. As we created a fork of the berlios  
chan_sccp to bring this work forward, we don't want it merely to be  
based on &quot;our stuff&quot; because we started it.

So on this occasion again: Please submit your patches or tell about  
your custom version of chan_sccp. We really with to re-unite all the  
useful however &quot;stray&quot; patches and pieces of code out there. I know  
how much work it is to actually identify the changes entered  
quick&amp;dirty into one's own source tree, but it's definitely worth it.

Attached to this mail is the most recent version of Marcello's and  
mine joint work. I just added a feature that I had to unravel from my  
own legacy 1.2 tree: Using the global option &quot;recorddigittimeoutchar  
= on&quot;, the '#' to terminate variable-length numbers as they commonly  
occur in European countries, is recorded to the call logs if it was  
dialed at first. So redialing works without manual post-dialing the #  
from the logs.
