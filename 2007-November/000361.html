<PRE>Dear list members,

Latest chan_sccp - I nearly lost my biggest customer yesterday over phone system reliability problems. I would be very grateful to know when it will be possible to download the latest chan_sccp for Asterisk 1.4 complete with any known good patches - it really is critical that I can move forward in the next two weeks. I know that some versions have been attached to previous postings, but I am not really confident of applying patches. What reason (perhaps only time) that the current tree can not be released?

Phone firmware versions - Any chance we can get agreement on the best firmware versions for the various models?

DST/locale settings - Can anyone explain what files are needed to correctly localise Cisco phone 7940/7941/7960/7961 etc. During UK DST time all my 7940/7960 phones showed the correct time and my 7961 phone was 1 hour out. Now that DST has ended, all my 7940/7960s are 1 hour out and 7961 is correct! I would like my 7961 to show the date in UK format eg. d/m/y as my 7940/7960 already do (taken from sccp.conf). I know that there was a change in the way locale settings are used between 7940/7960 series and 7941/7961 series. I have access to Cisco downloads.

Caller id when transferring calls - I have also noticed that incoming caller id is lost when a call is transferred (assisted transfer). My users would expect to see the details of the original caller after the incoming call has been connected. I always thought that this was one of the benefits of the sccp that the PBX can re-write the display as necessary and thus change the info displayed?

Cisco router with CME 4 available - I am happy to donate a Cisco 1721 router complete with CME 4 to anyone who can really use it to further the cause of integration. This does list models 7941/7961 etc. I am happy to send this via courier to anywhere in Europe. I purchased this to debug how the lights on 7914s are controlled to allow more functionality in chan_sccp, but will propbably never get the time to do this.

UK PRI/ISDN30 settings - Is there anyone else in the UK using Digium E1 cards with PRI/ISDN30 lines? I have had a recent issue with one customer where customers ringing in were getting a busy signal and yet Asterisk/Zaptel showed no issues. I guess I need to debug PRI stuff, but this is fairly complex. I would be interested to know what settings anyone else uses for:

Timing source (I'm sure BT told me that the exchange should always provide the timing source)
Reset B channels: On or Off
Distance from NTE
Echo settings

Many thanks.

Martin
