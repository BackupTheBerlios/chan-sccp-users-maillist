<PRE>Hi Martin,

yes, we included the patch dealing with the invalid number condition,  
and I can't remember any problems related to it to occuring since then.

In the meantime, I also received the router and just started to make  
myself familiar with it. Many thanks again for that generous  
donation, and hopefully we will soon be able to resolve the remaining  
(protocol based) issues with its help.

By the way -- does the installed CME 4 support meetme conferences?  
Marcello and I would like to have a look at those in the near future.

But now, to the end of debugging, it would also be very if you could  
run asterisk from gdb and reproduce the problem.

This is done as follows:

1. Shut down your asterisk task
2. Run asterisk in gdb:

gdb asterisk
(gdb) set args -vf
(gdb) run
Starting program: /usr/sbin/asterisk -vf

....
Asterisk crashes
...

(gdb) bt

Then, please mail the backtrace that follows as well as the firmware  
version you're running on your phone.

I post this procedure once more to both lists even though you and  
many others may be familiar with it. However, there had been some  
requests as how to do these traces, so I think it might be helpful.

Regards and many thanks again,
-David.
