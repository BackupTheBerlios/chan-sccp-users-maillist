<PRE>If you can send me a list of the features you are using, plus the
features you tried to use but failed.  Please send as much information
at me as you can.

Initially I'll post back some time next week a list of &quot;supported
features&quot; with the current sccp drivers relative to Asterisk 1.2 and
1.4, and against the SIP load with Asterisk.  After I get some agreement
this list is accurate, I would like to post it to a wiki along with
configuration examples for each feature.

So if you can send me your asterisk and SCCP driver version at a
minimum.  Then something as simple as transfer works for me but not
ad-hoc conferencing would be fine.  Or if you are comfortable with
sharing I'd like your phone load version, configuration examples and
anything else you are willing to throw my way.

I'll be digging through this list to start a rough draft.  But I figured
if I could get fresh information from interested parties it may help
save some time.

Please send it to pmowry at getgds dot com instead of the list if you
can.

Thanks for your time,

-Patrick
