Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] Cisco 7970 + chan-sccp: no audio,
	keeps unregistering
Message-ID: <0CE9DAE5-38E4-4B15-9EDC-2A4670BFD13F@gmail.com>

Hello list users!

I've got problem connecting Cisco 7970 to Asterisk with chan-sccp-b.
While 7960 & 7940 working flawlessly, with 7970 I cannot get audio on  
calls, or phone just freezes on call with no audio, or freezes just  
after first attempt to make a call; also phone just keep dropping  
connection to server with : "unregister request sent"

While playing with sccp.conf I've encountered, that different  
protocolversion= variables gives various results: sometimes call goes  
through, sometimes phone works a bit longer than before.

Tried different versions of chan-sccp-b -- no help.


Thanks in advance,
help is greatly appreciated

max
