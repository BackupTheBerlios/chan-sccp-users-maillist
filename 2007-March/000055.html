<PRE>I was able to get chan-sccp working via NAT where both sides were on Dynamic
DNS. My setup consists of a mix of Linksys routers as well as a DLink
routers! I think the trick is to correctly setup the port forwarding on the
NAT in front of your asterisk server. My setup is essentially 79XX -&gt; NAT -&gt;
Internet -&gt; NAT -&gt; Asterisk. Everything works fine and I can both receive
and make outgoing calls without issue. My VM indicator light on my 79XX
works fine in this setup as well.

Firstly, I register my Linksys router that is in front of my asterisk server
with DynDNS. This allows me to refer to my asterisk server as
&quot;asterisk.dyndns.org&quot;. I then need to configure port forwarding on this
router to forward the necessary ports to my internal asterisk server. There
are essentially 3 port-forwarding configurations I need to make:

- forward TCP on port 2000 (SCCP) to your internal asterisk server
- forward your RTP UDP ports to your internal asterisk server (the RTP port
range depends what you have configured in your rtp.conf file - rtpstart and
rtpend values)

The above two port forwarding rules are configured using the default
port-range forwarding screen on the Linksys routers (this is the screen
where you can specify the external port ranges i.e. 2000 to 2000 for SCCP or
10000-15000 for RTP).

The other port forward you need to do is for TFTP support on the 79XX series
phones. I usually configure TFTP port forwarding via the UPNP forwarding
screen instead of the default port-range forwarding screen (I just find it
easier). To do this, simply click on the UPnP Forwarding button found at the
bottom of the port-range forwarding screen and make sure the radio button is
selected on UDP for TFTP protocol (69). Also fill in the IP address for your
internal TFTP server (usually its installed on the same box as asterisk) and
make sure you select the &quot;enable&quot; checkbox. Save your changes on your
Linksys and you should be good to go from the router side of things.

Finally, you need to setup a few settings under the [general] section in
sccp.conf:

localnet = 192.168.1.0/24  ; your local asterisk server network subnet
externhost = asterisk.dyndns.org  ; this should be your DynDNS hostname to
use in the RTP media stream
externrefresh = 60  ; expire time in seconds for hostname

After restarting asterisk, everything should be setup from the asterisk
behind NAT side of things.

To configure a 79XX phone that is behind a NAT router, all I had to do is
specify the TFTP address for the 79XX to grab its SEPXX.cnf.xml file from -
assuming you already have a properly configured SEPXX.cnf.xml file (in the
sep file, refer to your DynDNS name in the processNodeName element instead
of an IP address).

I have this setup working with both a 79XX behind a cheap Linksys router as
well as 79XX behind a cheap DLink router and it works fine. I did have to
flash the DLink to the latest firmware to fix some earlier problem I had
with getting TFTP to work through a NAT but other than that everything works
for me (tm).

Almost forgot, I couldn't get the default TFTP server that ships with Debian
(atftp) working properly in this type of setup because it uses random ports
to send back your TFTP SEPXX.cnf.xml file. In order to get TFTP to work via
port forwarding and NAT, I had to use a java based TFTP program called
fwtftpd which always answers using the same sourceport it listens on (i.e.
port 69). I couldn't fine any other native Linux based TFTP server that
offered this ability.

Thanks,
  I think I can put a Cisco 26xx at each side, but if I'm gonna do that
I should see if I can get a VPN to work with the dynamic addressing.
I'll play with both the VPN and firewall fixup configs to see what
happens.

Subject: Re: [Chan-sccp-users] SCCP Phone through NAT

The general problem with this set up is that you end up with either no
audio 
or one-way audio...

SCCP is built on ASN.1 and is NAT encumbered, by this I mean that the
SCCP 
protocol (TCP/2000) conveys IP addresses/port numbers for the RTP stream
to 
setup inside the ASN.1 -- if you want this to work I think you'll need a

Cisco router like the 837-K9 (or a dumb Etherner modem and a PIX
firewall) 
and have to use the &quot;protocol fixup skinny&quot; feature so that the
router(or 
pix) correctly modifies the SCCP payload data while in transit...

Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] SCCP Phone through NAT


&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>  I noticed in the release notes for chan_sccp that NAT support was
</I>&gt;<i> added awhile back.  Now I have an actual use for it.  I cannot setup a
</I>&gt;<i> VPN between two sites since neither side has a static IP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I wanted to setup Asterisk with ports forwarded from the local
</I>&gt;<i> firewall to be connected to by a 7940 behind a DSL router, also doing
</I>&gt;<i> NAT.  I would configured the phone to connect to a hostname (using
</I>&gt;<i> dyndns.org I assume) and have the SCCP ports forwarded to it as well
</I>&gt;<i> since I only need one phone at the remote site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone ever try something like this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Patrick
