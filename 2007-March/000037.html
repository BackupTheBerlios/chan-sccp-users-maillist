<PRE>Hi All,

Got Asterisk 1.2 up and running fine with chan_sccp and some Cisco
phones without many problems bar one.

The Ciscos have a GPickUP softkey but I cannot for my life get this to
do anything? does anyone have a guide or a FAQ/www page on how this
works.

I have *8(ext) working which is useful but I would like to use the
softkey.

Does the key relate to the callgroup and pickupgroup config settings? 

I see in the config mentions of this but as of yet I have never seen the
key do anything other than create a line. If I press it and a valid ext
it rings! Pretty sure that's not right.

Can anyone help out at all?

Thanks

Steve
