<PRE>I noticed that this version has the realtime patch applied.  Does it
work?  Are any special extconfig.conf or sccp.conf settings needed?

Martin,

maybe you would like to the current version for 1.4 Marcello and I  
have assembled from our and recent patches. Note that this version  
runs without crashes in both Marcello's and mine testing  
environments, comprised of the same kind of devices you use.

I attached the current tree for you to try, despite it will only work  
with * 1.4 as of now. We shall back-port it once...

I also use a 7920 on a regular basis and have never had any crashes  
except for when i used channel on for the wifi connection. Seems odd,  
but resolved when changing to a higher channel. Maybe a problem with  
the access point.


Regards and much luck with your issues,
-David.
