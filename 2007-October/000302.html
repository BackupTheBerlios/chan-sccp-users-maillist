<PRE>Martin,

maybe you would like to the current version for 1.4 Marcello and I  
have assembled from our and recent patches. Note that this version  
runs without crashes in both Marcello's and mine testing  
environments, comprised of the same kind of devices you use.

I attached the current tree for you to try, despite it will only work  
with * 1.4 as of now. We shall back-port it once...

I also use a 7920 on a regular basis and have never had any crashes  
except for when i used channel on for the wifi connection. Seems odd,  
but resolved when changing to a higher channel. Maybe a problem with  
the access point.


Regards and much luck with your issues,
-David.
