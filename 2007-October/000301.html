<PRE>Dear list members,
 
I've placed the Asterisk 1.2 version of chan_sccp that I use on an FTP server as follows:
 
Server IP: 80.168.79.8
login name: chan-sccp
login pass: chan-sccp
 
I would be very grateful if someone could compare this with the 20060408 to see the changes. I have found this to be the most stable version so far, although there are still crashes every few days. I was comtemplating upgrading to 1.4, but really worry that the current 1.4 version may actually crash more often with the setup that I use (7940s, 7960s, 7960+7914s with call parking, voicemail etc). Asterisk 1.2 seems to die after a deadlock has been avoided! I've heard that Asterisk 1.4 gets a seg fault.
 
I have given up using paging to handsets (I use the sound card in the server connected to amp and loudspeakers), since it seems to kill the 7914 - presumably so many extensions changing status at the same time is too much.
 
I have recently purchased a 7920 wireless phone (watch out, you have to order the battery separately!). So far the voicemail indication doesn't seem to work and my patch to prevent crashes after a redial tone/timeout for 7960+7914 causes real problems. I need to do more work on this. I'll probably end up using the new Snom m3 DECT SIP phones for my mobile users.
 
We really need to strive to get a version that only crashes once per week. Already one of my customers has converted to SIP and has never looked back (no crashes for months). I would like to help in this effort as much as possible, but am not a C programmer.
 
Best regards,
 
Martin
