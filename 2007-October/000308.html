<PRE>Hi,

you will have to ask Marcello for the realtime functionality -- it's  
his work, and I'm curious to try it myself when I have the time.

Concerning my work, there is the service url functionality. Instead  
of a speeddial or a line, you can now configure any of these buttons  
to trigger an XML page. This could come in handy, for instance, to  
directly jump to the search form of you phonebook, or to open the  
front door via http ;-)

The syntax is like

serviceURL = Label,<A HREF="http://my.url">http://my.url</A>

in a device section. Please note that the order of lines, speddials  
and serviceURLs now gets a bit complicated as there are three kinds  
of button entries

First, the lines are allocated at the specified positions.

Second, the speeddials fill the free positions, leaving out those  
positions with an empty speeddial.

Last, all now free buttons are filled in order with serviceURLs, also  
leaving out positions with an empty entry.


I know that this is very unintuitive, and indeed Marcello and I have  
already discussed several ways to completly redesign the way buttons  
are configured in chan_sccp, as clearly this has to be improved.

If you need an example, just ask me.


Regards and much fun with the chan ;-),
-David.

</I>&gt;<i> Martin,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> maybe you would like to the current version for 1.4 Marcello and I
</I>&gt;<i> have assembled from our and recent patches. Note that this version
</I>&gt;<i> runs without crashes in both Marcello's and mine testing
</I>&gt;<i> environments, comprised of the same kind of devices you use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I attached the current tree for you to try, despite it will only work
</I>&gt;<i> with * 1.4 as of now. We shall back-port it once...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also use a 7920 on a regular basis and have never had any crashes
</I>&gt;<i> except for when i used channel on for the wifi connection. Seems odd,
</I>&gt;<i> but resolved when changing to a higher channel. Maybe a problem with
</I>&gt;<i> the access point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards and much luck with your issues,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've placed the Asterisk 1.2 version of chan_sccp that I use on an

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Server IP: 80.168.79.8
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> login name: chan-sccp

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would be very grateful if someone could compare this with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 20060408 to see the changes. I have found this to be the most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stable version so far, although there are still crashes every few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> days. I was comtemplating upgrading to 1.4, but really worry that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the current 1.4 version may actually crash more often with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> setup that I use (7940s, 7960s, 7960+7914s with call parking,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voicemail etc). Asterisk 1.2 seems to die after a deadlock has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> avoided! I've heard that Asterisk 1.4 gets a seg fault.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have given up using paging to handsets (I use the sound card in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the server connected to amp and loudspeakers), since it seems to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kill the 7914 - presumably so many extensions changing status at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same time is too much.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have recently purchased a 7920 wireless phone (watch out, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to order the battery separately!). So far the voicemail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indication doesn't seem to work and my patch to prevent crashes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> after a redial tone/timeout for 7960+7914 causes real problems. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to do more work on this. I'll probably end up using the new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Snom m3 DECT SIP phones for my mobile users.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We really need to strive to get a version that only crashes once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> per week. Already one of my customers has converted to SIP and has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> never looked back (no crashes for months). I would like to help in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this effort as much as possible, but am not a C programmer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
