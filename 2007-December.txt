Hei everybody!

Finally, I managed to get Internet again (only GPRS yet...), so I'm back
to the list.

First of all... As some might know, I have moved to Finland and my
personal situation changed dramatically, so I have absolutely no time
and peace to maintain chan-sccp.org any more.

So if really nobody is willing to take it over, I will unregister the
domain and then it will likely drop to some domain-grabber company
putting porn ads there or something... :-).

So, anybody interested? Just drop me a mail!

Yst?ll?visin terveisin,
Stefan

Hi,

If someone is willing to maintain the page, I can take care of the hosting.
Or if nobody can maintain the page I can put up a temporary page.

Steven.

I'm using a mixed type of sccp, zap and sip channels.

Is there something in extensions.conf or sip.conf i should set ?

Thanks

You must make sure you are using the hint subsystem.

There is a lot of documentation online.

Here is some info:

Thanks for the offers so far. Maybe I should make clear, what I am
searching for.

The domain should either

1) be sold to a company which does business with Asterisk and maybe also
chan-sccp

2) be given to a group of motivated people who are involved with chan-sccp

My original intention was to support the project by providing a website
with documentations, help, latest patches and a webforum because as I am
not a programmer, this was the best way for me to support it.
Just having the domain idling on a server is not what I want. Actually
this is what is happening now and I am not happy with that.
I look for some people who would continue the project in the original
spirit, either privately or commercially.

Hi Stefan,

we are a German ISP using chan-sccp for customer projects and
our own company telephone system.

We are interested in taking over the domain and the project. Currently we are
planning to push the project at differing Universities in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
to find more people interested in the project.

Please let me know if that sounds good.

Best regards to Finland.

Sebastian Lehn

I still have problems with one of latest cisco firmware that hangs phones as 
it doesn't hangup calls on wrong number, busy or congestion state, locking 
the display.

I'm using image "cmterm-7940-7960-sccp.8-0-5" (P00308000500).

If anyone tryied or fixed it please let me know.

I made a little patch commenting the set_callstate in sccp_indicate but some 
of you told it's not the right way.

Can anyone find a solution for my problem ?

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

I almost forgot to mention to the list:

We released chan-sccp-b-20071213, which also includes Fredericos's  
latest patch.


Does anybody have an idea what would be an appropriate replacement  
for setting the callstate?
Maybe just a display message?

Thank,
-David.

Hi all,

I didn't check latest release (i have manually fixed the 20071114 one) but 
often, during transfers (not blind),
happens segfault.

How could i check for this ?

Thanks

Federico

Message-ID: <5174563.121197938594168.JavaMail.root@mail.linkdc.co.uk>

Dear list members,

I recently tried to move to Asterisk 1.4.x with the latest chan-sccp-b on a system running a mixture of 7940s, 7960s and 7961+7914s and immediately the system crashed when testing assisted transfers. Having primed the end users for some months that a new version was going to solve the crashes every few days, it was a great disappointment and I had to roll back. The decision has now been made to abandon sccp and move to SIP and the Cisco 7961+7914s will be replaced by Polycom IP601s and side cars. Having stuck to my guns over Cisco handsets and native protocol over the last 1.5 years, I have now made the personal decision to move to SIP and will not risk putting any more Cisco handsets in with native protocol and will probably move to Polycom handsets entirely. I very much thank those who have contributed to the effort, but end users will simply not accept that a PBX should have the same reliable as their PCs, and the problems over the last year have damaged my reputation with long standing customers who I provide I.T. support for.

Good luck and best regards,

Martin Sutherland

I'm sorry to hear that. I'm using Asterisk 1.4 (latest svn) with
chan-sccp-b 20071111 on a CentOS 5.1 box and Cisco 7961s with factory
default skinny firmware and have not seen any crashes. Don't think I
ever tried assisted transfers so can not comment on that functionality
and thus of little use to you. Without any more info about your setup
it's difficult to make suggestions (unless you already did that off
course). Have you thought about hiring one of the core developers to
sort out the problems?

While I'm a happy user of chan-sccp-b and appreciate the hard work of
the chan-sccp-b community very much I also acknowledge the fact that
Cisco's Skinny implementation is rather proprietary which makes it quite
difficult to make this driver work 100% with Cisco phones. Therefor I
understand your decision to move to Polycom which uses standards based
SIP and is much more focused on making their products work well with PBX
vendors including Digium than Cisco will ever be.

You sure have hung in there for a long time given your problems. I also
use SIP phones and am quite happy with them. Hopefully your experience
will be the same.

I hope that your switch to Polycom/SIP will work out for you and your
customer(s). The Polycom phones have a solid reputation in spite of a
rather steep configuration learning curve. Prepare to spend some time to
get the provisioning sorted out. Make sure you get the Polycom phones
from an official Polycom distributor/reseller that can provide you with
the latest firmware. FWIW I prefer the IP430 and IP650 because of the
backlit screens.

Best of luck!

Patrick

Hi Martin,

I have the same enviorment. Asterisk 1.4.xx, Cisco 7960, 7912, 7914 and Kirk
Wireless Server. We are productive with our company. This means more then 30
telephones are running and people are doing blind and assistant transfers,
without any crashes. In the moment I am not sure which chan_sccp driver I am
using, but I can provide you with it. Maybe you should give the system a
last chance.

Have a nice day

Marcus

Martin,

I run several Asterisk boxes, at work, at home and for various friends 
and family.

We love Cisco handsets but use them in SIP mode, with SIP firmware, and 
have 7905s, 7912s, 7940s, 7960s and 7970s all working well with Asterisk 
without any crashes!  The user interface changes a little to that of the 
SCCP phones, but everything "just works" as long as you are careful and 
select the right versions of SIP firmware (not necessarily the latest 
because Cisco keep twiddling things to work with CCM 5.x)

I recommend that you save your investment in what are high quality 
phones and change out the firmware to SIP.  If you want to drop me a 
line off list then I can provide more details.



Regards



Mike Tubby

The customer is right, the PBX have to be stable and well tested.

chan_sccp channel driver is an opensource software with no support from 
cisco, so it is not stable or tested enought for a production environment.
It could work... it should work... but there could be a configuration

I'm very sad to hear that. This is especially because Marcello and I  
didn't experience any further crashes related to transfers any more,  
and we hoped that the current release would be a solid base for most  
people.

Furthermore, I feel particularly sorry for your situation as you made  
that generous donation to the both of us. In connection to this, it  
shall be noted that you thus made possible many of the improvements  
and new fixed that we lately did. Although we could get on with quite  
some compatiblity issues and new features, the implementation and  
debugging is always another issue.

As Asterisk makes vast use of multithreading, debugging becomes a  
really formidable task, and it will always be. This is where only  
extensive debugging and the effort of many together trying to find the  
issues in various scenarious will be able to help; Ideally, running a  
production system with gdb on a very fast machine.

I can very well understand your decision, and I'd also suggest you  
that course of action if your customers have a very high load and  
can't live with occasional crashes. Although the stability may be  
quite well in the light of the high load, it may simply not be  
sufficient for your customers, so you need solutions where you can  
blame the manufacturer, also in terms of liability. Obviously chan- 
sccp-b can't provide sufficient stability right now, so you need to  
look for alternatives. As polycom officially supports asterisk, this  
should be your choice.

Finally, this should remember all of us that we still have a long way  
to go. Yet, there's already so much to find along that way that we  
should pursue it further.


Best regards and all the best,
-David

I've got some problems on transfers too, expecially in mixed environments
SCCP/SIP/IAX.

I didn't recognize the problem at the moment. I looked onto every log but 
atm
nothing.

If anyone could suggest me something for debug, the help will be 
appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Federico

Hi,

I also noticed some problems when performing transfers in mixed  
environments lately. I first thought the issue was due to some  
unorthodox use of meetme rooms in connection with local channels, but  
then it also occured with a transfer _to_ a Zap channel.

My problem is characterized by the following phenomenon:

1. You attempt a transfer and it doesn't work. Possibly the phone  
won't react properly.
2. If you type "show channels" at the asterisk prompt, it will give  
you an infinite list of the same channel all over again.
3. You need to restart asterisk.

The problem seems to occur only with 1.4.

By the way it's pretty nasty that you can really mess up the global  
channel list of asterisk in such a way.

We shall get working on the problem shorty, but it would be very  
helpful if any of you could reproduce it  and / or get his/her hands  
on it.


Kind Regards,
-David.

The code has been patched on the hangup code adding a soft hangup 
instead of a real channel hangup

I the the channels are marked as zombie channels

I've had two or three crashes in the past two or three weeks.  So far
unreproducible.  The last one happened during a blind transfer, but we're
pretty sure the one before that wasn't related to a transfer.

I've been waiting to see a pattern or something that I could add that would
be more informative than simply a "me too".

I can say the blind transfer crash occurred with an incoming Zaptel channel
answered by a 7960, then transferred to an extension that rings a couple of
times (the dialplan produces the ringing) and then dumps to voicemail.

Hi Satish,

unfortunately, we have not implemented the native conferencing  
features yet. There would be various ways to implement it, one of them  
simply creating a user interface to the meetme conference feature of  
asterisk through the user interface of the phone.

If you'd be interested in helping develop that feature we'd very much  
appreciate it.
