<PRE>Thanks to all who have replied to my question.

 

I think I may have made some progress in my situation. Below is the
output I get now.

 

NAME             DEVICE           MWI  Chs  Active Channel

================ ================ ==== ====
=================================================

TEST             10.0.0.100      SEP00136090A798  Ok

 

If I understand this correctly the phone is registering with asterisk
but the phone isn't configured to use extension 6000?

 

Thanks in advance for any help, it is truly appreciated!

Subject: Cisco 7960 with SCCP and asterisk

 

Hello, all.

 

I am trying to configure some Cisco 7960G phones to work with sccp and
asterisk. I have successfully loaded the sccp driver on the asterisk
machine. I have also loaded the sccp firmware on the phone. My problem
is that the phone is not registering with the asterisk machine.

 

I have tried asking for help on the trixbox forums and pbxinaflash
forums as well but have not gotten the help I need.

 

You can see the two links here: 
<A HREF="http://pbxinaflash.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5807">http://pbxinaflash.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5807</A> and

-sccp 

 

I am willing to pay for this if someone can help me out. I am
desperately trying to get it work.


Thanks!
