Well I managed to track down version 6 for these 7960s but I still can't get
the phone to download the new image.

 

Here's a TFTP log:

OS79XX.TXT looks like this:

I've tried two SEP00blahblah.cnf using the xml format and the old style one.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

The older versions don't seem to use the OS79XX sometimes.  Put the <loadInformation> in the SEPxx file.

A little bit of an update.
Two other phones I have are using 3.2, I've been able to get these guys to
upgrade as they actually request an XMLDefault.cnf.xml

However the super old guy with P003P301 isn't requesting this file.
It seems to ignore anything I put in SEPmac.cnf

The XMLDefault.cnf.xml is case sensitive, check the exact format in tftplog.

You can google for a sample of the XMLDefault file and put it on TFTP and then follow the cisco upgrade path by editing the file to include the image you want to load. The phone has a different load image from version 6, so may need to go to v4 then to v6 then to latest version. I'll check onn CCO for the upgrade path for you.

It seems to ignore anything I put in SEPmac.cnf

It's not even requesting that file when SEPmac.cnf doesn't exist.
It doesn't seem to like xml config files... perhaps there's an older format
for sccp?

The XMLDefault.cnf.xml is case sensitive, check the exact format in tftplog.

You can google for a sample of the XMLDefault file and put it on TFTP and
then follow the cisco upgrade path by editing the file to include the image
you want to load. The phone has a different load image from version 6, so
may need to go to v4 then to v6 then to latest version. I'll check onn CCO
for the upgrade path for you.

I think for a phone load that old, the sepdefault.cnf and sep<MAC>.cnf were actually a binary file.  I think Asterisk has a perl script to generate the sepdefault.cnf.  If you give me your server IP address and the MAC of the phone, I can try using the CallManager behind me to make one for you.

I didn't know this:

"Note that the OS79XX.txt file only gets you between protocol versions as the phone only checks the first four letters of the load name."

What may work for you is to get the phone on a SIP load and then change OS79XX.txt to get it back to a newer skinny load.  Doesn't sound very nice, but it might help.

It's not even requesting that file when SEPmac.cnf doesn't exist.
It doesn't seem to like xml config files... perhaps there's an older format
for sccp?

The XMLDefault.cnf.xml is case sensitive, check the exact format in tftplog.

You can google for a sample of the XMLDefault file and put it on TFTP and
then follow the cisco upgrade path by editing the file to include the image
you want to load. The phone has a different load image from version 6, so
may need to go to v4 then to v6 then to latest version. I'll check onn CCO
for the upgrade path for you.

A little bit of an update.
Two other phones I have are using 3.2, I've been able to get these guys to
upgrade as they actually request an XMLDefault.cnf.xml

However the super old guy with P003P301 isn't requesting this file.
It seems to ignore anything I put in SEPmac.cnf

the phone to download the new image.

The. File needs to be in the tftproot. If youi don't have the file it's looking for, change the load information it the XMLDefault.cnf.xml file or in the SEPxxx.cnf to match the bin file name you do have in tftproot.

Hi all,

yes, that is so. The config file used to be in binary format for the  
old versions, even for the 79xx series. I have succeeded to create  
one by means of a hex editor and this wiki page:

http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Configuring+Cisco+12SP+phones+with 
+Asterisk

For updating firmware, you will have to specify the image name in  
asterisk via the corresponding phone section sccp.conf (see examples  
or the source code).


Best regards,
-David

Message-ID: <cdae243a0704031236i2fe76741q343d9779827cb3ef@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
  Does anyone have chan_sccp working with * 1.4.x? I have applied the patch
suggested to the latest chan_sccp source. Using several 30VIPs things appear
to work for a bit and then the dialtone disappears and the phones crash.

Thanks,
Chris

I'm using it with 7960s and 7910s and haven't had any problems.  I
couldn't get my 30VIPs to work reliably.  Sometimes they worked, most
times not.  I thought they worked, but turns out that was with Call
Manager.  I never got a chance to get back with you before about them.
 I was hoping I'd be able to look further into it, but time is scarce
these days.

I understand about the time factor 100%. I think I am going to dump the
30VIPs for the time being. I have been pouring over the source for both
chan_skinny and chan_sccp hopeing to contribute by correcting some of the
issues, but I really need to get this system up and running as a "proof of
concept" for replacing an NEC pbx, and I am new and green to *. So the time
factor again....

Thanks for the word.

That did it!

I created a binary config for the phone, it successfully registered to
asterisk then proceeded to download the newest SCCP firmware from my TFTP
server. It is now happily registered with the latest firmware :)

I'd like to thank you all for helping out, couldn't have done it without
you! I hope others will benefit from this as well.

Again thanks.

Hi all,

yes, that is so. The config file used to be in binary format for the  
old versions, even for the 79xx series. I have succeeded to create  
one by means of a hex editor and this wiki page:

http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Configuring+Cisco+12SP+phones+with 
+Asterisk

For updating firmware, you will have to specify the image name in  
asterisk via the corresponding phone section sccp.conf (see examples  
or the source code).


Best regards,
-David

I assume the problem you are having with the 30VIPs is specific to * 1.4
I have 30VIPs and 12SPs running with no issue with * 1.2.

 

Question for the group, is chan_sccp for * 1.4 still very much a work in
progress?

 

Thanks,

 

Scott

I'm using it with 7960s and 7910s and haven't had any problems.  I
couldn't get my 30VIPs to work reliably.  Sometimes they worked, most
times not.  I thought they worked, but turns out that was with Call 
Manager.  I never got a chance to get back with you before about them.
I was hoping I'd be able to look further into it, but time is scarce
these days.

 

I understand about the time factor 100%. I think I am going to dump the
30VIPs for the time being. I have been pouring over the source for both
chan_skinny and chan_sccp hopeing to contribute by correcting some of
the issues, but I really need to get this system up and running as a
"proof of concept" for replacing an NEC pbx, and I am new and green to
*. So the time factor again.... 

 

Thanks for the word.

 

Chris

Most likely since my chan_sccp is patched to run with 1.4, but I have
not run * 1.2

Would you mind posting a 30VIP section from your sccp.conf? I am using
some parameters which I am not sure apply to the 30VIP. Perhaps I have
something in the config that is causing the issue.

Hi.

If anyone is using the 7970 with chan_sccp and * can you tell me which
SCCP firmware you have found to be the most stable. I have one here
running 7.0.1 which keeps loosing the lower status line and other
options until restarted.

:-(

Is it worth going to a version 8? Or staying with the version 7's but a
later build?

Thanks

Steve

Both version 8 and 7 seem to work fine for me.
I did have a problem with keepalive which caused the phone to de-register
all the time.
That was solved by setting keepalive=0 in sccp.conf
Perhaps that's what's causing your problem?

Hope this helps

Interesting, I did read somewhere in the release notes about the
keepalive option being a fix for the 7970.

I have it as a global for 30 (s?) so should I add this to the 7970
device config and set it to 0 yes?

Thanks

Hey,

Done; added keepaline = 0 for my 7970 config section in chan_sccp; so
now giving it a go, will report back to the list on the success of it or
not.

Thanks

Hallo,

 

we also patched the chan_sccp to work with Asterisk 1.4, but we have serious
problems when we use the Transfer option. Asterisk dies directly. Does
anyone have a workaround for this problem?

Would someone be kind enough to post instructions for patching chan-sccp
for *1.4.  I am reasonably adept at administering Linux and following
instructions but patching builds is beyond my experience.   

I tried and ended up with errors I could not work through.

Thanks in advance

Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] 7960 multiple lines
Message-ID: <200704220709.l3M79on2002248@srv1.nickelnetworks.com>

Maybe someone can share some light on my issue. After many hours dealing
with sccp, I was able to make trixbox 2.0/asterisk 1.2 work with my 7960
using P00308000500 firmware. I really don't know if that is the best
firmware to use, is just the only one I was given so if there is one older
better please let me know.

Anyway, my question is how to enable all the 6 lines on the phone. Right now
only 1 lines (the top one) is enabled.

Here is my sccp.conf file. I tried using autologin   = 301,301 and different
combinations and it only shows 1 line. However, if I use autologin   =
301,302 it shows line 1 as 301 and line 2 as 302.

I am sure there is a way of doing it.

Regards,

Paul

Each line will only show up once, you can't have duplicates of the same
line.
If you get another call it will just be listed on the display.

What you could do is create 6 different lines and make the label the same.
Then write your dialplan to ring them in sequence.

Paul, thanks, that helps a little. I guess you have to use the green up/down
button to select the line instead of the lines on the side to pickup the
line. Weird, SIP allows you do to it. I also noticed that there is no
"Conference" option?
My ancient nbx allows me that option, there must be an easy way to do
that...

Also, if I pickup a line and just dial *, it then kinda goes like in mute
and you cannot use then the speakerphone or the handset. Is like the phone
is dead, you can get calls, but no way to answer them.

And last, in SIP you can reboot the phone by pressing *+6+Setting button.
Any way to do it in Cssp?

Each line will only show up once, you can't have duplicates of the same
line.
If you get another call it will just be listed on the display.

What you could do is create 6 different lines and make the label the same.
Then write your dialplan to ring them in sequence.

Hi,

With the conference option I cannot help you, even I don?T know what you
mean.

I think the "Hold" Softbutton fits the best to your request of the *.

In Skinny, you have to go to Settings and press step by step *, #, *.
Depends on the firmware you have to go to Settings + Network.

Did you have a lot success with firmware 8.5? I am using 8.1 and it works
fine, the only bug is that the recording of Missed calls and placed calls is
done by looking to the subscribed group.

Could you please check if they fixed the following bug, which appears in
8.2: Pickup the phone and do nothing. After some seconds the display shows
"External call". If you try to hang up now the phone freezes. In 8.1 this is
working. A short reply would be very nice!

I found that downgrading to this firmware cures that issue P00307020300. The later 8x's seem to have some issues with the tones that * sends over for certain events.

Hi Marcus,

Someone on this list said that 8.0.1 is the best version to use. We have had good uptimes with 7.2.3 which is what we have running now on all our 7940 and 7960s. They did arrive with SIP 8.6 which we removed and went to SCCP and *.

A guy on here said something after 8.0.1 changed and as a result they do not work as well with SCCP and *. We found all our issues were cured by using that firmware.

Regards,

Steve

Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] SCCP StationCallInfoV2Message
Message-ID: <001501c7877a$f1ea1c00$970010ac@mitchpc>

Does anyone have the structure to the newer SCCP message
"StationCallInfoV2Message"   MSGID=0x14a.   It replaces the message
"CallInfoMessage"
 
 
Thanks
 
Mitch
