This is great news because I would hate to use Asterisk 1.2 again.  1.4 is a
lot stable from what I'm doing.

My question is, since this is a patch how do I install this if I can't
install the version that is not compatible
so Asterisk 1.4.0?  How would I install this?  I haven't installed something
like this before.  Any help and
steps here (including any good sites) would be great!

Thanks

CP

Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] Asterisk 1.2 & Cisco 7940/60 and GroupPickup
Message-ID: <792897337FC81944BA4097ABD7089771030A5E84@pdc.bnsnet.co.uk>

Hi All,

Got Asterisk 1.2 up and running fine with chan_sccp and some Cisco
phones without many problems bar one.

The Ciscos have a GPickUP softkey but I cannot for my life get this to
do anything? does anyone have a guide or a FAQ/www page on how this
works.

I have *8(ext) working which is useful but I would like to use the
softkey.

Does the key relate to the callgroup and pickupgroup config settings? 

I see in the config mentions of this but as of yet I have never seen the
key do anything other than create a line. If I press it and a valid ext
it rings! Pretty sure that's not right.

Can anyone help out at all?

Thanks

Steve

The GPickUP softkey is to get a parked call back.
E.g. if you park a call, then you will get the announcement of the park position (e.g. 701).
To get the call back, press GPickUP -> enter 701 (park position)

This seems to work.  Is the pbxcc chan_sccp the last release from
Sergio?  It looks like it.  I haven't tried to see if it has the
meetme problems or if that has already been patched.  Calling,
parking, and holding work.

Be sure you account for invalid extensions.  I forgot about that and
locked the phone up.

Hi Marcello,

it would be cool if you could publish a completely patched version of
chan_sccp for asterisk 1.4 because we're having problems with it too.
We tried to apply the suggested patch but it didn't compile afterwards
:<
thanks in advance for your efforts

Hi Marchello, All,

Thanks, that worked a treat but leaves me one question does the SCCP
driver support the call pickup/group pickup, I know that *8<ext> works
(Which is *) but how any where do you tell the sccp driver what the call
groups and pickup groups are?

I have now 95% of it working as I would like but I see in the chan_sccp
conf settings for the callpickup and grouppickup = the examples point to
groups 1,2,4 etc - what do they refer to ? call groups in * or something
I have missed in the docs?

And amaflags? Is that meant to be set to nothing or =documentation? 

Seems this is one of the hardest parts of the chan_sccp setup is that
lots of the options are not mentioned anywhere in decent form. 

The example config works but there seems to be lots of options that are
there and default but nothing written up about them.

Examples are the setup for lines & speedials. Which I have working on my
7940 and 7960 BUT I am not sure if I have them right. I have followed
the examples and yes I can make and rx calls and call other ext's but
comments like autologin= then a line number? 

I have this for me three phones:

[devices]

type        = 7940
description = Steve
autologin   = 202
speeddial   = 201,Sarah,201 at from-internal
transfer    = on
park        = on
dtmfmode    = outofband
device => SEP0014F2290773

type        = 7940
description = Peter
autologin   = 222
speeddial   = 201,Sarah,201 at from-internal
transfer    = on
park        = on
dtmfmode    = outofband
device => SEP001319E0EC85

type        = 7960
description = Sarah
autologin   = 201
speeddial   = 202,Steve,202 at from-internal
speeddial   = 222,Peter,222 at from-internal
speeddial   = 
speeddial   = 505,Sales,505 at from-internal
speeddial   = 506,Tech,506 at from-internal
transfer    = on
park        = on
dtmfmode    = outofband
device => SEP0013C3BAA90D

[lines]
id            = 202
pin           = blahblah
label         = 202
description   = Steve
context       = from-internal
mailbox       = 202
vmnum         = *97
cid_name      = Steve
cid_num       = 202
incominglimit = 2
callgroup     = 1
pickupgroup   = 1
line => 202

id            = 222
pin           = blahblah
label         = 222
description   = Peter
context       = from-internal
mailbox       = 222
vmnum         = *97
cid_name      = Peter
cid_num       = 222
incominglimit = 2
callgroup     = 1
pickupgroup   = 1
line => 222

id            = 201
pin           = blahblah
label         = 201
description   = Sarah
context       = from-internal
mailbox       = 201
vmnum         = *97
cid_name      = Sarah
cid_num       = 201
incominglimit = 2
callgroup     = 1
pickupgroup   = 1
line => 201

Now looking at other configs I see comments like:

autologin   = line79052,,line79052	; lines list. You can add an
empty line which you see on the officail website. Is my config right
when it comes to lines? And ext's?

Do you create a line with whatever outbound number you want to present
(we have one E1 and 1 VOIP outbound with different numbers) are they
config'd as lines?

Like:

[lines]

label       = 084509991001		; button line label (7960, 7970,
7940, 7920)
description = Line 08450		; top diplay description
context     = ????? from-internal ?????
cid_name = IIS				; caller id name
cid_num = 084509991001
;callgroup=1,3-4				; We are in caller
groups 1,3,4.
;pickupgroup=1,3-5			; We can do call pickup for call
groups
line => 79051

Would that be a line? If so what's the correct context? from-internal I
know is an internal call.

And the groups, do they match *'s callgroup and pickupgroups? I have two
ring groups are they the same? 

Am I thinking that a ring group say 500 would be a callgroup and
pickupgroup? Or am I reading it wrong?

Sorry for a long winded question but with no one seeming doing a decent
FAQ! I need to ask at the only place people seem to be covering
chan_sccp on *.

Thanks

Steve

I think the group pickup works a litle bit different.
If you have a an active call and you press the park softkey, asterisk will tell you the number of the parkposition (e.g. 701) -> call ist parked and your line is hanged up.
Now, if you want to get the parked call back -> press GPickUp -> enter the announced number (701) and you have the call back.

This is how the group pickup works.

have a nice weekend

Hi Marcello thanks for the file and the link to website to download this
patched version.  How would I install this?  I did a make/make install and
received minimal info:

[root at rhel01tra chan_sccp]# make
sh ./create_config.sh "/usr/include"
: command not found line 10: 
: command not found line 12: 
./create_config.sh: line 194: syntax error: unexpected end of file
make: *** [.config] Error 2

Is there something I am missing here or need to do?  Thanks!

CP

Hello,
  I noticed in the release notes for chan_sccp that NAT support was
added awhile back.  Now I have an actual use for it.  I cannot setup a
VPN between two sites since neither side has a static IP.

So I wanted to setup Asterisk with ports forwarded from the local
firewall to be connected to by a 7940 behind a DSL router, also doing
NAT.  I would configured the phone to connect to a hostname (using
dyndns.org I assume) and have the SCCP ports forwarded to it as well
since I only need one phone at the remote site.

Anyone ever try something like this?

Thanks,

-Patrick

SCCP works behind NAT, but not all NATs!

A simple Linux router will not forward packets correctly after a few calls. 
I don't know why.

A modern Linksys router will.

That same router running DD-WRT will as well (Linux!)

The must be something peculiar about the way it allocates ports, because it 
always seems to work for a little while once asterisk is started, then you 
lose the inbound voice path after several calls.  (using either the Linux 
router or any of a handful of cheap WiFi routers)

Interestingly, an older (pre-Cisco buyout) Linksys router will also not work 
properly.  Hmm.  ;-)

The general problem with this set up is that you end up with either no audio 
or one-way audio...

SCCP is built on ASN.1 and is NAT encumbered, by this I mean that the SCCP 
protocol (TCP/2000) conveys IP addresses/port numbers for the RTP stream to 
setup inside the ASN.1 -- if you want this to work I think you'll need a 
Cisco router like the 837-K9 (or a dumb Etherner modem and a PIX firewall) 
and have to use the "protocol fixup skinny" feature so that the router(or 
pix) correctly modifies the SCCP payload data while in transit...

FYI, Fortinet and Netscreen both claim to support SCCP in their newer 
releases of software, although I haven't actually tried either one. 
Outside of Cisco hardware, those are the only firewalls that I have seen 
that actually claim to support it.

Hi,

I think there is something wrong by executing the create_config.sh file.
Can you try executing the create_config.sh manually?
It seems you have a problem with the bourne shell. On which system you tried it?

Thanks,
  I think I can put a Cisco 26xx at each side, but if I'm gonna do that
I should see if I can get a VPN to work with the dynamic addressing.
I'll play with both the VPN and firewall fixup configs to see what
happens.

The general problem with this set up is that you end up with either no
audio 
or one-way audio...

SCCP is built on ASN.1 and is NAT encumbered, by this I mean that the
SCCP 
protocol (TCP/2000) conveys IP addresses/port numbers for the RTP stream
to 
setup inside the ASN.1 -- if you want this to work I think you'll need a

Cisco router like the 837-K9 (or a dumb Etherner modem and a PIX
firewall) 
and have to use the "protocol fixup skinny" feature so that the
router(or 
pix) correctly modifies the SCCP payload data while in transit...

I was able to get chan-sccp working via NAT where both sides were on Dynamic
DNS. My setup consists of a mix of Linksys routers as well as a DLink
routers! I think the trick is to correctly setup the port forwarding on the
NAT in front of your asterisk server. My setup is essentially 79XX -> NAT ->
Internet -> NAT -> Asterisk. Everything works fine and I can both receive
and make outgoing calls without issue. My VM indicator light on my 79XX
works fine in this setup as well.

Firstly, I register my Linksys router that is in front of my asterisk server
with DynDNS. This allows me to refer to my asterisk server as
"asterisk.dyndns.org". I then need to configure port forwarding on this
router to forward the necessary ports to my internal asterisk server. There
are essentially 3 port-forwarding configurations I need to make:

- forward TCP on port 2000 (SCCP) to your internal asterisk server
- forward your RTP UDP ports to your internal asterisk server (the RTP port
range depends what you have configured in your rtp.conf file - rtpstart and
rtpend values)

The above two port forwarding rules are configured using the default
port-range forwarding screen on the Linksys routers (this is the screen
where you can specify the external port ranges i.e. 2000 to 2000 for SCCP or
10000-15000 for RTP).

The other port forward you need to do is for TFTP support on the 79XX series
phones. I usually configure TFTP port forwarding via the UPNP forwarding
screen instead of the default port-range forwarding screen (I just find it
easier). To do this, simply click on the UPnP Forwarding button found at the
bottom of the port-range forwarding screen and make sure the radio button is
selected on UDP for TFTP protocol (69). Also fill in the IP address for your
internal TFTP server (usually its installed on the same box as asterisk) and
make sure you select the "enable" checkbox. Save your changes on your
Linksys and you should be good to go from the router side of things.

Finally, you need to setup a few settings under the [general] section in
sccp.conf:

localnet = 192.168.1.0/24  ; your local asterisk server network subnet
externhost = asterisk.dyndns.org  ; this should be your DynDNS hostname to
use in the RTP media stream
externrefresh = 60  ; expire time in seconds for hostname

After restarting asterisk, everything should be setup from the asterisk
behind NAT side of things.

To configure a 79XX phone that is behind a NAT router, all I had to do is
specify the TFTP address for the 79XX to grab its SEPXX.cnf.xml file from -
assuming you already have a properly configured SEPXX.cnf.xml file (in the
sep file, refer to your DynDNS name in the processNodeName element instead
of an IP address).

I have this setup working with both a 79XX behind a cheap Linksys router as
well as 79XX behind a cheap DLink router and it works fine. I did have to
flash the DLink to the latest firmware to fix some earlier problem I had
with getting TFTP to work through a NAT but other than that everything works
for me (tm).

Almost forgot, I couldn't get the default TFTP server that ships with Debian
(atftp) working properly in this type of setup because it uses random ports
to send back your TFTP SEPXX.cnf.xml file. In order to get TFTP to work via
port forwarding and NAT, I had to use a java based TFTP program called
fwtftpd which always answers using the same sourceport it listens on (i.e.
port 69). I couldn't fine any other native Linux based TFTP server that
offered this ability.

Hi, I running the following on my system:

[root at rhel01tra chan_sccp]# cat /proc/version 
Linux version 2.6.9-22.EL (bhcompile at porky.build.redhat.com) (gcc version
3.4.4 20050721 (Red Hat 3.4.4-2)) #1 Mon Sep 19 18:20:28 EDT 2005


When I try the run the create_config.sh file manually I get the following:

[root at rhel01tra chan_sccp]# bash create_config.sh
: command not foundine 10: 
: command not foundine 12: 
create_config.sh: line 194: syntax error: unexpected end of file


Anything else I could try or is there some limitation with my system or
kernel version?  Thanks!

CP

Hi,

I think there is something wrong by executing the create_config.sh file.
Can you try executing the create_config.sh manually?
It seems you have a problem with the bourne shell. On which system you tried
it?

Message-ID: <792897337FC81944BA4097ABD7089771030A60D0@pdc.bnsnet.co.uk>

Hi all,

Got my 7914 today, one quick question, what colors are the lights when
using chan_sccp, I have got it to show red lights when calls or phones
are in use. 

What other colors can it do? Green? Amber? None :-(

Is anything needed to be done? Elsewhere in the config?

Regards,

Steve

It'll do the same colors the 7970/61/41 will do.
Green when on call/hold, amber when ringing and red when a line is busy.
For hints it will only show up red when the extension is busy/ringing.

I believe this is a limitation of the firmware on the phone and
unfortunately can't be changed.

Hi!

About the firmware limitation, I have to agree to that, I'm afraid. I  
have several 7914s myself and would be amazed about the prospect of  
getting a multi-color-switching-blinking gadget from those. What  
doesn't work in particular is speed-dialing an extension that is lit  
red (for indicating in use). If it wasn't for that, it would at least  
be possible to use the red buttons as toggles. But that doesn't work;  
the phone just doesn't send anything but says "line in use". I shall  
get my hands on wireshark for that.

I'd be happy to hear of any clues about this issue.


Regards,
-David

Hi,

Thanks for the help. I found after spending a while on google this
snippet which saved the day!

The lamp is green when you are on the line, blinking green when you put 
the line on hold, blinks orange when you call that line. 

If you have a 7960 and wanted a line on the 7914 you could do it this 
way: 
autologin = ,,,,,,79140,79141 ; This makes it go to the 7th button which
is button 1 on the 7914.

Or as a speed dial (lamp is either off or red)  You setup a speed dial
like this: 
speeddial = 5501,Some User, 5501 at from-sccp

They work a treat! Really impressed with it and would say to anyone who
has a lot of speed dials or lines the 7914 is the nuts :-)

Regards,

Steve

My asterisk (linux) server smoothly handled the new daylight savings time switchover, and has the correct time, but all the SCCP phones seem to have the time still "stuck" one hour earlier.  Anyone else experiencing this?

Doesn't the phone get it's time from the server?   Reboots don't seem to effect it, nor does a temp fix by using the tzoffset configuration variable.

Yeah, the phones get the time from the server.  Many services only read from /etc/locatime on startup.  Have you tried rebooting the server or restarting Asterisk?  If the phones aren't receiving the tzoffset changes then sccp.conf hasn't been reloaded.

Thanks for the tips, but I rebooted the entire box.  No changes.   Test phone is a 7970, maybe there is something that needs updating in the Locale?

  For the 7970 the new DST rules are present in the following phone firmware releases: 8.0(4)SR3 and 8.2(1). Customers must download and implement these firmware loads..  But even then, it does not always work properly.  All the 7970's in my office worked fine, but a few customers have had issues.  I believe the Cisco bug ID is CSCsh12444 and will be fixed in firmware 8.2.2.  From the reports I've read, multiple reboots of the phone may be needed if just the firmware upgrade is not enough.

The older phones like the 7940 and 7960 do not need a firware upgrade.  Details for the phones are at:

same thing here, I had to change my tz_offset an hour earlier to get the 
correct time.

I guess you need to reboot the PHONE.
AFAIK, phones take the time at startup and keep the time from there...

  For the 7970 the new DST rules are present in the following phone firmware 
releases: 8.0(4)SR3 and 8.2(1). Customers must download and implement these 
firmware loads..  But even then, it does not always work properly.  All the 
7970's in my office worked fine, but a few customers have had issues.  I 
believe the Cisco bug ID is CSCsh12444 and will be fixed in firmware 8.2.2.

Updates to the field notice say to issue a reset of the phone from CallManager to fix the time on a 7970, and may have to be done each time the phone looses power until 8.2.2 is released.  I've never tried to reset a phone from within asterisk, but I believe you can.

The older phones like the 7940 and 7960 do not need a firware upgrade.  Details for the phones are at:

Yeah, the phones get the time from the server.? Many services only read from /etc/locatime on startup.? Have you tried rebooting the server or restarting Asterisk?? If the phones aren't receiving the tzoffset changes then sccp.conf hasn't been reloaded.

My asterisk (linux) server smoothly handled the new daylight savings time switchover, and has the correct time, but all the SCCP phones seem to have the time still "stuck" one hour earlier.? Anyone else experiencing this?

Doesn't the phone get it's time from the server??? Reboots don't seem to effect it, nor does a temp fix by using the tzoffset configuration variable.

I've been trying to get my 7970 to show the proper time for quite a while
today.
Changing the timezone in the SEPXXXX.cnf.xml  didn't work.
Changing tzoffset didn't work.
Sccp reset/restart SEPXXX didn't work even when making any of those changes.

Still looking for ideas...

Actually it appears changing tzoffset does work.
It just shouldn't have a + sign in it.
So right now I have tzoffset=1 and the correct time on my phone :D

Seems to work ok if I just specify "7914" as the device type.  Not sure if 
there will be any other unintended consequences, but it's working ok right 
now!

I also had to add the expansion module info to my SEP.cnf.xml:

<addOnModules>
<addOnModule idx="1">
<loadInformation>S00105000100</loadInformation>
</addOnModule>
</addOnModules>

I added it right past <loadInformation>.

I've done this in the past and it worked fine.  It also works with a 7961.

Just FYI, I flashed the latest firmware (8-0-4SR3AS) into my 7970's, and it 
has fixed the stupid DST issue.  I wonder how many programmer-hours that 
stupid change has caused?

  For the 7970 the new DST rules are present in the following phone firmware

releases: 8.0(4)SR3 and 8.2(1). Customers must download and implement these
firmware loads..  But even then, it does not always work properly.  All the
7970's in my office worked fine, but a few customers have had issues.  I
believe the Cisco bug ID is CSCsh12444 and will be fixed in firmware 8.2.2.
>From the reports I've read, multiple reboots of the phone may be needed if
just the firmware upgrade is not enough.

The older phones like the 7940 and 7960 do not need a firware upgrade.
Details for the phones are at:

Yeah, the phones get the time from the server. Many services only read from
/etc/locatime on startup. Have you tried rebooting the server or restarting
Asterisk? If the phones aren't receiving the tzoffset changes then sccp.conf

hasn't been reloaded.

My asterisk (linux) server smoothly handled the new daylight savings time
switchover, and has the correct time, but all the SCCP phones seem to have
the time still "stuck" one hour earlier. Anyone else experiencing this?

Doesn't the phone get it's time from the server? Reboots don't seem to

By the way, by telling people where to get firmware to fix their buggy 
products, I in no way intend to circumvent Cisco's right to make profits.

We all recognize that all the Cisco IP phones are world-class, and 
well-built devices.  I personally think Cisco should make available bugfixes 
for free to customers that have decided to invest in their products.  As far 
as I know these updates are not adding features to the phones, but rather 
are bug fixes for existing and documented issues.  By enabling people to fix 
their Cisco phones, it opens up new potential markets.  It's hard to impress 
someone with buggy gear!

I do fully support Cisco, and have paid access to COO.  I am not giving away 
access, but I have discovered many open avenues for obtaining such updates 
that are feely open on the internet.  If Cisco requests that I stop pointing 
people to there, I will be happy to comply.

This is for all the developers and hackers on this list that don't have the 
resources to gain access to COO in order to make everyone's world better, 
including Cisco's!

Sorry to have upset anyone on this list.

Well I had hoped to find a 7970 upgrade how to somewhere online, but no
luck.

Tinkering around didn't really get me anywhere either.

Can anyone lend a hand?

Put  all the files contained in the archive in the root of your TFTP server.

In your SEPxx~.cnf.xml file, make sure you have this (rooted as far as I 
know, mine is somewhere in the middle):

 <loadInformation>SCCP70.8-0-4SR3AS</loadInformation>

Make sure the version matches your current firmware files.

I also usually put it in the sccp.conf file for the device:

imageversion = SCCP70.8-0-4SR3AS

Just put it right before the device => SEPxx~ line.

When the phone reboots, it will fetch the version and will begin visibly 
doing the load.  It's very good at reporting what's going on compared to the 
older models.  If you have a backlight setting that is not always on, you 
may discover (as I did) that the backlight stays off during the upgrade 
process.  You cannot turn it on manually, even though the LED on the lower 
right button is lit.   A bright flashlight aimed at the screen will reveal 
what is happening.

Obviously yet another bug!

I advise you to watch the log of your TFTP server for case problems if you 
can, as sometimes the files have mixed up case that Cisco supplies.   If 
there is an option to disable case sensitivity in your TFTP server, do so.

I saw this problem occur in the most recent version, so it WILL FAIL if your 
TFTP server is case sensitive unless you fix the case to match what the 
phone is seeking.

If these steps don't work let me know, I have other tips but I doubt you'll 
have trouble.

The 7060/40 is way less picky!

I know it's used in SIP, but something is stuck in my head telling me it's 
used for the secure encryption functions in SCCP.  (something we can't yet 
play with)

There is a lot of hits in Google, and this: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value

Maybe someone else will chime in?

You will notice that the phone looks for all kinds of interesting stuff when 
it boots.  Most is not needed.

Let me ask you a question, does your backlight stay on all day until 8pm, 
then turn off?   If you turn it on, does it go off again in 10?

Mine was going off in 10 all day, so it seemed like it was effectively 
ignoring the "force on" of the parameters.

I think mine is set for 7 or 8 and it stays on until then.  At night,
I can turn it on with the button (or by using the phone) and it'll
stay on for a while (guess maybe 10 minutes) and then go off.  It
turns on automatically at whatever time in the morning I have it set
for (I think 7.)

Yes it turns on right at 12 and stays on until 8, where it'll be up for 10
minutes.

However when I did try changing the settings the phone seemed to ignore it
unless I did a factory reset.

Let me ask you a question, does your backlight stay on all day until 8pm, 
then turn off?   If you turn it on, does it go off again in 10?

Mine was going off in 10 all day, so it seemed like it was effectively 
ignoring the "force on" of the parameters.

Wow... that was easy. :P
Went through the entire process with the backlight on... then again I have
mine set to a 10 minute time out, on until 8pm.

I'm curious about the .tlv file the phone requests, any idea what it's for?

Thanks again

Put  all the files contained in the archive in the root of your TFTP server.

In your SEPxx~.cnf.xml file, make sure you have this (rooted as far as I
know, mine is somewhere in the middle):

 <loadInformation>SCCP70.8-0-4SR3AS</loadInformation>

Make sure the version matches your current firmware files.

I also usually put it in the sccp.conf file for the device:

imageversion = SCCP70.8-0-4SR3AS

Just put it right before the device => SEPxx~ line.

When the phone reboots, it will fetch the version and will begin visibly
doing the load.  It's very good at reporting what's going on compared to the

older models.  If you have a backlight setting that is not always on, you
may discover (as I did) that the backlight stays off during the upgrade
process.  You cannot turn it on manually, even though the LED on the lower
right button is lit.   A bright flashlight aimed at the screen will reveal
what is happening.

Obviously yet another bug!

I advise you to watch the log of your TFTP server for case problems if you
can, as sometimes the files have mixed up case that Cisco supplies.   If
there is an option to disable case sensitivity in your TFTP server, do so.

I saw this problem occur in the most recent version, so it WILL FAIL if your

TFTP server is case sensitive unless you fix the case to match what the
phone is seeking.

If these steps don't work let me know, I have other tips but I doubt you'll
have trouble.

The 7060/40 is way less picky!

Yeah there is definitely some inconsistent behavior with this feature.

I'm really annoyed that you can't simply press the backlight button and turn 
it off whenever you like.   Holding it turns the touchscreen on/off, but the 
backlight stays on.

Sometimes you gotta wonder about their engineers!

Hi all.

We have a setup working as per the guides on the web but I have noticed
that placed and missed calls work fine but the received call directory
contains no records at all. So you cannot use that to redial someone who
rang you!

Is this firmware or a config option? I have amaflags = documentation
which I read did this but has made no difference.

Any clues? Debug does not really show anything either :-(

Thanks

Steve

Hi Sam,

We are running SCCP FW version P00308000500. So from what you are saying
this is pretty much busted in that regard then.

Bummer. Time to visit CCO and grab 8.0.1, is that the most stable for
these phones with *, I have noticed people keep on about 7.2? is that
recommended or just what people have found works well?

I must say we don't "have" any issues with that FW above other than what
I noticed. Unless it explains the crash when you leave it off the hook?

Regards,

Steve

No, to see if you are affected by that bug dial an invalid extension or
just # (digittimeoutchar).  On newer firmwares the phone will lock up if
you don't have an i extensions defined in extensions.conf.

I've had the best luck with 8.0.1.  It plays nicer with the Open 79XX
XML directory than earlier versions and doesn't have the bugs of the
later versions.  I haven't seen any added benefit to the newer firmwares
so you're not really giving anything up that I'm aware of.

Hi Sam,

I have P00307010200 laying about which I might try with a 7940 later on
as a test if it is ok then I will grab P00308000(?)400 and downgrade
from P00308000500 if it all goes well.

However a quick Google and I did find this:

7940/7960
7.2(2)[P00307020200] 
** Most stable version 
8.0(4)[P00308000400] 
**Works in most environments, but can have issues playing multicast
audio packets related to cisco bugs CSCsh61510 and CSCsg92860. 

Do I assume then that P00308000400 is 8.0.(4) and P00308000100 is
8.0.(1) ?

I can confirm that this is also the case with a 7961 with factory
default Skinny firmware (some ancient 3.something version).

Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] Wireless Cisco phones
Message-ID: <C555B7706EC80044B32DC5E718BEBD9201DCA869@fileserver>

Has anyone tried to get one of the wireless Cisco phones working with
chan_sccp2/Asterisk?

 

I'd like to give the 7921G a try but hate to go buy one if it may not
work.

 

Also, is this still the primary forum for chan_sccp2 discussions?  I've
been out of the loop for a while and haven't seen much activity here.

 

Thanks,

Hi,

The 7920 seems to work ok from reports. I have one on order so I cannot
comment yet. But reading on the forums shows good success rates with
chan_sccp.

As for it being busy from what I can see the project is very fragmented
with various people in various places having modified the code to suit
:-(

But I have found here that most questions do get answered or if not
Google for it - you tend to find most questions have already been asked
and answered.

Hi,

I have a couple of 7920 working perfectly with version 20060204. Fully supported (But imho it's a very poor phone)
But I'll not bet on 7921 being compatible with 7920 signaling and I really don't know about compatibility between chan_sccp(1/2/skinny/armed branch) and 7921.
As far as I can remember, Sergio had to modify code to support 7961 when 7960 was fully supported.

See ya

Good to know.  Well, we support a large number of Cisco phones on a CCM system.  I'll see if any of those clients are interested in a 7921G to see if I'll have a "free" way of testing it.  :)

Hi,
  Does anyone on the list have 30VIP's configured and working with
chan_sccp on * 1.4.x? I have been able to patch and compile chan_sccp
for 1.4. It loads and the 30 registers fine. From there I get a
variety of flavors of "No lines registered on...." when taking the
phone offhook and pressing any keys. Here is some of my sccp.conf:

[devices]

type=30
autologin=line51235
keepalive = 60
dtmfmode = inband
imageversion = P002L2J2
device => SEP000196C00D3F

[lines]
id = 51235
pin = 1234
context = from-vip51235
incominglimit = 2
line => 51235

  Also, any suggestions as to what features of the 30VIP are supported
by chan_sccp would be appriciated.

Thanks,
Chris

There is an OS7900 file on the tftp server. It needs to be updated with the version of the bin file you have. The bin file then needs to be on the tftp route as well.

Hmm
This one seems to download the OS79XX.TXT file as well as SEPmacaddr.cnf (no
.xml). 

Changing the loadinformation tags in SEPmac.cnf or the version in OS79XX.TXT
doesn't seem to do anything.

Is your tftp server on linux? Tail the tftp log file and then reboot the phone to check which files it's downloading. If the unit is version 3 (factory default) then you need to upgrade to version 6 prior to any newer releases.

Hmm
This one seems to download the OS79XX.TXT file as well as SEPmacaddr.cnf (no
.xml). 

Changing the loadinformation tags in SEPmac.cnf or the version in OS79XX.TXT
doesn't seem to do anything.

There is an OS7900 file on the tftp server. It needs to be updated with the
version of the bin file you have. The bin file then needs to be on the tftp
route as well.

Any pointers on how to upgrade a 7960's SCCP firmware?

Is your tftp server on linux? Tail the tftp log file and then reboot the
phone to check which files it's downloading. If the unit is version 3
(factory default) then you need to upgrade to version 6 prior to any newer
releases.
