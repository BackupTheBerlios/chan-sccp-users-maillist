Message-ID: <00A24AA921915B4D99E90311BC1632F00D43FA@exchange2k3.five-fifteen.local>

Hello, all.

 

I am trying to configure some Cisco 7960G phones to work with sccp and
asterisk. I have successfully loaded the sccp driver on the asterisk
machine. I have also loaded the sccp firmware on the phone. My problem
is that the phone is not registering with the asterisk machine.

 

I have tried asking for help on the trixbox forums and pbxinaflash
forums as well but have not gotten the help I need.

 

You can see the two links here: 
http://pbxinaflash.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5807 and 
http://trixbox.org/forums/trixbox-forums/jobs-board/need-cisco-7960-work
-sccp 

 

I am willing to pay for this if someone can help me out. I am
desperately trying to get it work.


Thanks!

If I understand this correctly the phone is registering with asterisk

Hello, all.

 

I am trying to configure some Cisco 7960G phones to work with sccp and asterisk. I have successfully loaded the sccp driver on the asterisk machine. I have also loaded the sccp firmware on the phone. My problem is that the phone is not registering with the asterisk machine.

 

I have tried asking for help on the trixbox forums and pbxinaflash forums as well but have not gotten the help I need.

 

You can see the two links here: http://pbxinaflash.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5807 and http://trixbox.org/forums/trixbox-forums/jobs-board/need-cisco-7960-work-sccp 

 

I am willing to pay for this if someone can help me out. I am desperately trying to get it work.
