<PRE>Hi all,

Happy New Year and all that.

I have been wondering if this is possible with * and chan_sccp. We have
a mixed 7940/60/70 system working fine. We have 6 channels delivered
over a E1 PRI to the * box and it is all working fine.

What I would like to know if I had say a 7970G and had the buttons set
as line 1 Ext, line 2 DDI, then the other 6 buttons could they be set to
hint the 6 real ZAP channels? so that an incoming call on the ZAP(1) say
could be seen by the phone? is something like this possible?

We have it set currently that incoming calls ring both receptions which
is fine - but if we could see the ZAP channels on the other handsets
that would be great. 

Maybe even for the 7960s + 7914s see the ZAP's on the buttons on the
sidecar? Not sure if anyone has done this or even if it is possible.

An example or pointers would be great.

Regards,

--
