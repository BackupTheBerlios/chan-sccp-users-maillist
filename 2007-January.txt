Hi
	Does anyone have a working SEP<Mac>.cnf.xml file for a 7961 with the
7914 side car. I can't seem to get it right and the phone looks up at
least 4 times a week.

Thanks For the help

Hi Kelly,

look at the following config-file. It's designed for a 7970. Watch out
for the two "addOnModule" Sections. You need one for each 7914 exp. units.
There's a good description at http://www.voip-info.org for this one.

hth.

Regards,

- -Andreas.

Message-ID: <710bae00701050204g23397f63l1273d07149b5379f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

in a last attempt to get a working, usable SCCP channel for asterisk 1.4,
i'm offering two bountys:


1. $100 USD (PayPal)

- patch against chan_sccp 20060408
- GPL (obviously)


2. $500 USD (PayPal)

- patch against chan_skinny from asterisk 1.4
- properly disclamed to digium for inclusion in the official asterisk svn
- includes all features of chan_sccp


The first one should be pretty easy, the loader work has already been done
and is available at
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pbxcc/modules/chan_sccp, so it's just
the rtp stuff that has to be done. I guess a look at how the changes where
done to chan_skinny would help. Bounty can be collected after i've done the
first successfull call (without crash ;-)).

The second one will be much harder, you more-or-less have to rebuild all
features from scratch, based on chan_skinny. Technically, i dont care how it
is done, if someone can convince/bribe Sergio to disclame his patches you
can safe a lot of time and work. Bounty can be collected after inclusion in
the digium svn with all features of chan_sccp.

If you wish to collect the second bounty, please contact me in advance.

Hi,

I'd like to contribute to solution 1, i.e. porting chan_sccp to  
Asterisk 1.4. Not only as of usability and features, but also in  
terms of compatibility, I have experienced chan_sccp to be the more  
mature implementation. The chan_skinny implementation on the other  
hand, will most likely survive on its own, as it's in the * svn.  
Saving chan_skinny for the future would be my concern.

However, I'd have to get an overview of the work to be done before  
accepting the bounty, and I will most likely have the time to do so  
by next week. Earlier today, Jay R. said, there was only some work  
with the RTP code left, but I understand that asterisk 1.4 has a much  
different api than 1.2. Could anybody fill me in on what to do to get  
something from 1.2 simply to compile in 1.4?


Kind regards,
-David

Hi,

 

we are using chan_sccp with * 1.2.14, 35 Cisco phones and it works quite
well. Why should we change to Asterisk 1.4. I can not find any reason at
this time. Awaiting that chan_skinny is developing with all the features of
chan_sccp is the most common way for us. 

 

Can someone explain the main difference between both Asterisk versions? We
are likely to support the chan_sccp as well as the chan_skinny solution, but
it has to work. 
 and even more the code should under GPL afterwards.

 

We are also a German company and paying via Paypal is not the problem, but
getting an invoice :-)

 

Have a nice day, 

 

Awaiting your comments

 

Marcus

Hi,

I am using * 1.2.13-BRIstuffed-0.3.0-PRE-1v with the florz patch  
serving several patched hfc-s cards, about 10 cisco phones, a few  
isdn phones, an agfeo as32 pbx, and finally some snom phones. For me,  
a transition to 1.4 will be of interest as soon as all the bristuff- 
related stuff has been ported to 1.4 as well.

I'm sure there are many other people around relying on bristuff.

There are several disagreements among developers as how to integrate  
the Line paradigm into the asterisk architecture, some would like to  
adopt the paradigm, some not. I'd like to do a mixture of both,  
making things even more complicated.

In this light, I think it'd be vital for _multiple_ implentations of  
sccp to survive, one of which being under GPL resolving some of the  
"political" issues mentioned above. Anyways I doubt that chan_skinny  
will soon come close to the functionality and robustness of chan_sccp.


We should start porting chan_sccp 1.4 early to make sure the project  
will stay alive in the future, but only for this reason (or for a  
bounty, as it was offered). Beyond that, my concern is about  
implementing more native features of the cisco phones, like shared  
lines, direct transfer between calls, dynamic logon/logoff with  
configuration of line-keys, speeddial etc.

By the way: Anyone here with a 7936 he/she got working? I have one  
myself, however with the usual problem not being able to hangup after  
a few calls, and a lousy sound quality. It seems to me that there are  
dsp profiles to be uploaded to the station which are not present in  
the factory defaults.

I'd be curious to hear about your experiences, also in the "real"  
cisco world with a call-manager.

-David

Message-ID: <459F1B68.5040801@deakin.edu.au>

Hi,

I have a working chan_sccp with Asterisk 1.4.0. I have posted my patch
is posted at https://developer.berlios.de/patch/index.php.  It is
against the svn (which is why it is such a small patch :). I only have a
limited setup to test against, so please beware, but so far so good :)

As for why?  Well me, I want more integration with the other channels
(gtalk etc).., so 1.4.0 is a natural progression and have the ability to
break this one :)
If it was prod I would probably hold off. 

Oh, and I went to chan_skinny initially with 1.4.0, but didn't want to
spend time converting the configs. (too lazy?)

Regards

David



Hi,

 

we are using chan_sccp with * 1.2.14, 35 Cisco phones and it works quite
well. Why should we change to Asterisk 1.4. I can not find any reason at
this time. Awaiting that chan_skinny is developing with all the features of
chan_sccp is the most common way for us. 

 

Can someone explain the main difference between both Asterisk versions? We
are likely to support the chan_sccp as well as the chan_skinny solution, but
it has to work. 
 and even more the code should under GPL afterwards.

 

We are also a German company and paying via Paypal is not the problem, but
getting an invoice :-)

 

Have a nice day, 

 

Awaiting your comments

 

Marcus

Hi

we, the SEC-u-DIS GmbH (Germany), will support this LAST attempt to keep/get
SCCP alive for the community and us.

Thus, we will DOUBLE Jay?s bountys by  offering additional honeypots:

For solution 1): 100 USD

For solution 2): 500 USD (OUR PREFERENCE)

Hi

in a last attempt to get a working, usable SCCP channel for asterisk 1.4,
i'm offering two bountys:


1. $100 USD (PayPal)

- patch against chan_sccp 20060408
- GPL (obviously)


2. $500 USD (PayPal) 

- patch against chan_skinny from asterisk 1.4
- properly disclamed to digium for inclusion in the official asterisk svn
- includes all features of chan_sccp


The first one should be pretty easy, the loader work has already been done
and is available at
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pbxcc/modules/chan_sccp, so it's just
the rtp stuff that has to be done. I guess a look at how the changes where
done to chan_skinny would help. Bounty can be collected after i've done the
first successfull call (without crash ;-)). 

The second one will be much harder, you more-or-less have to rebuild all
features from scratch, based on chan_skinny. Technically, i dont care how it
is done, if someone can convince/bribe Sergio to disclame his patches you
can safe a lot of time and work. Bounty can be collected after inclusion in
the digium svn with all features of chan_sccp. 

If you wish to collect the second bounty, please contact me in advance.

Hi,

well, if your patch works fine, this sounds very promising. Go and  
collect your bounty ;-)

But seriously, we should test your patch and once its stability  
confirmed, contact Sergio about how to proceed integrating the code  
with the berlios svn and opening another branch for 1.4. We'd  
probably also want to merge the few but important fixes against the  
latest chan_sccp to the svn.

I understand that Sergio hasn't had much time for chan_sccp as of  
late, and it might be possible that he wouldn't want to manage the  
project any longer. Does anybody know something more specific about  
his current state?

I would be willing to continue the project administration or at least  
help Sergio, and I would be happy about anybody working towards the  
same end joining me in that effort.

Kind regards,
-David.

Hi David,

I would be willing to help on some of the contributions, esp towards  
having this working with 1.4. Whilst there are tons of C developers  
out there who would love to contribute, its the politics and overhead  
that puts people off. If you, or someone, sets up another branch of  
chan_sccp for 1.4.0 then count me in as well. I have the setup to  
hand as well as an asterisk 'expert'.

Hi Anthony,

I'd be happy to count on you for the future development of chan_sccp,  
esp. for * 1.4. However, there are a number of small yet imho  
important patches for chan_sccp; thus I believe, we should first  
think about adopting some new patches into a new branch. Based on  
this new branch we should then create the 1.4 branch. Otherwise, we  
might be doing this in the aftermath. What do you think?


Kind Regards,
-David

Hi David,
hi Antony,

count on us (Joerg and Dietmar) for a new branch too.

Time to get rid of the semi-dead status at chan_sccp which prevents from
using this pretty good stuff for production since a couple of month.

Regards

Dietmar

PS: Sorry Sergio, but you invited a lot of people to come with you on your
journey to running sccp implementation. They traveled with you for a long
time and had a fairly good trip. But then you stopped and decided to sit
down in the middle of nowhere. Thats not the kind of journey they like. So,
the decided to take it on their own...

yup, as soon as i have his account-id, he's getting paid, i've already
contacted him ;-)


But seriously, we should test your patch and once its stability


Agreed. I've allready done 10 calls with it, all the basic functions work,
with some minor problems:

- compile with PARK=y fails
- Pickup does not work even if compiled in (the Softkey does not show up)
- Setting an _alert-info does not work at all

Can someone confirm this? The last might be some other change in
asterisk...?

I have no idea who really has access to the sourceforge-svn,
but it would be great if this person could give commit access to anyone
who want's it, currently someone that wants to use chan_sccp with asterisk
1.4 need's to be able to do svn checkouts and apply various patches, thats
way to complicated for many...

At least we now have a version that basicly works with asterisk 1.4, i'm

Hi all,

 

where I can test the new version? I would like to be of any help even if I
am not a programmer, but I have whole company working on Asterisk using
chan_sccp and I can easily check all phones in a test environment.

Hi David,

2007/1/6, David Dederscheck <davidded at davidded.de>:

well, if your patch works fine, this sounds very promising. Go and
collect your bounty ;-)


yup, as soon as i have his account-id, he's getting paid, i've already
contacted him ;-)
 

 

But seriously, we should test your patch and once its stability


Agreed. I've allready done 10 calls with it, all the basic functions work, 
with some minor problems:

- compile with PARK=y fails
- Pickup does not work even if compiled in (the Softkey does not show up)
- Setting an _alert-info does not work at all

Can someone confirm this? The last might be some other change in
asterisk...? 
 

 

confirmed, contact Sergio about how to proceed integrating the code
with the berlios svn and opening another branch for 1.4. We'd
probably also want to merge the few but important fixes against the
latest chan_sccp to the svn.


I have no idea who really has access to the sourceforge-svn,
but it would be great if this person could give commit access to anyone 
who want's it, currently someone that wants to use chan_sccp with asterisk
1.4 need's to be able to do svn checkouts and apply various patches, thats
way to complicated for many...

sergio clearly stated that he don't want to use a public svn/cvs repository,
so 
i guess we won't get any help from him anyway...
 

 

I understand that Sergio hasn't had much time for chan_sccp as of 
late, and it might be possible that he wouldn't want to manage the
project any longer. Does anybody know something more specific about
his current state?


well, IMHO thats the whole problem. Noone knows what he's up to, and he
'aint tellin' :-( 

 

I would be willing to continue the project administration or at least
help Sergio, and I would be happy about anybody working towards the 
same end joining me in that effort.

I would also be willing to contribute code for future chan_sccp
development.  I had some 1.4BETA patches I was working on, but was
focusing more on native bridged call (conference) functions.  Not
knowing whether to work with the chan_sccp or chan_skinny development
has been (as was stated by previous others) has been a real drag.  I had
pretty much stopped writing code until either some clear direction

I would love to get this work incorporated into the asterisk dev

Hi David,

I would be willing to help on some of the contributions, esp towards  
having this working with 1.4. Whilst there are tons of C developers  
out there who would love to contribute, its the politics and overhead  
that puts people off. If you, or someone, sets up another branch of  
chan_sccp for 1.4.0 then count me in as well. I have the setup to

Hi Geoff,

I've setup a branch on sourceforge, within a couple of days this  
should be activated, we can setup the SVN repo and start work on the  
TODO list. Basically we need some experienced users of SCCP and the  
existing channel. Also access to a range of Cisco 79xx phones would  
be ideal. Especially those of you who are experiencing the bugs  
crashing asterisk, we'll specifically need people to setup debugging/ 
strace sessions to post to the group.
I am in no way taking this upon myself though, before I steal  
someone's thunder, we just think it would be a good idea to start a  
branch seeming as the community is more active than the project :-)
So far 3 other users want to contribute, so this should kick off  
quite quickly. We will set this up however (as you mentioned) to  
spread the overall responsibility amongst a few users to stop the  
same thing happening.

Regards,
Anthony

A test-installation with 7920, 7940, 7941 and 7970 phones is available,
I'd be happy to test updates/fixes.

Hi,

A new project has been setup on sourceforge now, for those of you  
whom asked to contribute if you could register on SourceForge and  
email me your usernames so I can add you as a project developer.  
Anyone wanting to help in administration can also do so if you let me  
know.
As the branch project no longer relates to this mailing list I won't  
post updates here.

Regards,
Anthony

Hi Lacy,

I've setup 2 mailing lists, one for discussion and one for releases,  
there is also a forum
the mailing list is here
http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/chan-sccp-b-discussion
and
http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/chan-sccp-b-releases
It may take another 24 to setup though (waiting for sourceforge)

Best Regards,
Anthony

I get a group pickup (gpickup) softkey on a 7960.  Is it different to
the pickup softkey you are after (is it the call pickup tag in sccp.conf?)
What is the config entry which would bring up the latter.

I can only confirm that ALERT_INFO (either set  via _ALERT_INFO or  
without the trailing underscore) doesn't work for me, even with the  
original chan_sccp2 (2006-04-28) with asterisk 1.2. However, setting  
the ringer directly via ringer=something in the dial application  
works fine.


Cheers,

I think ALERT_INFO only works with SIP devices.  chan_sccp has other ways to
signal different ringtones and auto answer.

And which are the other ways?
How can I set a ringtone for a configured line on a 7970?

  I think ALERT_INFO only works with SIP devices.  chan_sccp has other ways to signal different ringtones and auto answer.

   
  That's what I thought too...  ALERT_INFO (or more precisely _ALERT_INFO) causes a SIP channel to add the 'alert info' header to the outgoing invite to the SIP device...

Ok, here is an example:

exten => s,1,Dial(SCCP/101/aa1w)

This will cause the phone to autoanswer, but only the caller can talk (1
way).  Change aa1w to aa2w and you can have a two way conversation.

You can also use ringer= instead, such as:

 exten => s,1,Dial(SCCP/101/ringer=inside)

WIll ring with the inside tone.  You can use inside, feature, silent, and
urgent.  It defaults to outside.  I just noticed this in the code, it
appears you can use 1w or 2w instead of aa1w and aa2w.  I might be reading
that wrong, though.

I'm not sure if you can do it from a speeddial, but if you're calling an
outside number you could set the extension the speeddial calls to insert
pauses in the Dial() statement.

 

So, if you needed to call 555-5555 and then go to option 2, you could
have the following:

 

555555,1,Dial(Zap/g1/5555555wwwwww2)

And, because text is accepted and passed on in speeddial, you could have the
speeddial set to dial bank and then include:

exten => bank,1,Dial(Zap/g1/5555555wwwww2)

or something similar.  I guess even put in SpeedDial01 as the name and then
use SpeedDial01 in your dial plan.
