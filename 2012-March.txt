you pick up the phone, press the group pickup, then hang up.  Your
phone will then ring showing the caller ID information and then you
can either answer or let it go (I interpreted letting it go to mean
that continue based on what it should have done without the pickup, in
other words, it does not go to your voicemail.)

This is just my understanding.  I have not tried this yet.  I'll give
this a shot sometime this weekend to see exactly how it works.

just the firmware upgrade is not enough.

The older phones like the 7940 and 7960 do not need a firware upgrade. 
Details for the phones are at:

Yeah, the phones get the time from the server. Many services only read from 
/etc/locatime on startup. Have you tried rebooting the server or restarting 
Asterisk? If the phones aren't receiving the tzoffset changes then sccp.conf 
hasn't been reloaded.

My asterisk (linux) server smoothly handled the new daylight savings time 
switchover, and has the correct time, but all the SCCP phones seem to have 
the time still "stuck" one hour earlier. Anyone else experiencing this?

Doesn't the phone get it's time from the server? Reboots don't seem to 
effect it, nor does a temp fix by using the tzoffset configuration variable.

the device it is just a 7914 with scroll buttons and a colour display.

I assume that they button count(er) can just be increased in chan_sccp
to allow for those two types? It looks like they do not do anything
extra (tech) wise.

Trying it would be the best way. We have 7970s at the mo and two 7960s
with 7914s. I might get a 7916 to go with a 7970 and see how it works
under CCME and chan_sccp.

Depends on funds :-)

lines setup when it registers, the sccp debug 10 should show how many
lines sccp "thinks" you should have vs what you are using.

Do you see anything using "sccp debug 10" as the console when it
registers?

-- conf --

type        = 7921
description = 7921WiFi
autologin   = 801
speeddial   = 805,805,805 at from-internal
speeddial   = 806,806,806 at from-internal
private     = off
device => SEPetcetcetc

line => 801
id            = 801
pin           = 1234
