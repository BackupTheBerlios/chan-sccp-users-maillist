<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Maybe someone can share some light on my issue. After many hours dealing
with sccp, I was able to make trixbox 2.0/asterisk 1.2 work with my 7960
using P00308000500 firmware. I really don't know if that is the best
firmware to use, is just the only one I was given so if there is one older
better please let me know.

Anyway, my question is how to enable all the 6 lines on the phone. Right now
only 1 lines (the top one) is enabled.

Here is my sccp.conf file. I tried using autologin   = 301,301 and different
combinations and it only shows 1 line. However, if I use autologin   =
301,302 it shows line 1 as 301 and line 2 as 302.

I am sure there is a way of doing it.

Regards,

Paul
