Hi Frank,

thank you very much - We'll do that asap. It seems to me that you've  
brought us a big step forward towards a preliminary release on the  
sourceforge project website, which hopefully will yield us even more  
fixes and also new problems we don't even know yet ;-)

Well, but seriously, there are still some minor issues with the  
directories lists, which we haven't identified yet. I found that  
sometimes calls don't get registered in the lists at all, but this  
seems rather minor to me. Also, internal ringing cadences don't seem  
to work any more, which is annoying to me as I need it.

@Marcello: Could you please merge these two fixes if you have the  
time? Please use my last posted tree as the base version.

Regards,
-David.

I've noticed that on internal transfers (at least SCCP to SCCP), the caller
ID information gets updated.  I've also noticed that on external calls, the
caller ID info is not updated.  Has anyone got it working so that it is
updated in both situations?

Thanks!

When I wrote the transfer code there was no ways to collect the callerid 
from asterisk channels, maybe something changed in the meantime.

Actually, I was wrong.  The caller ID info is passing, sometimes.  I can't
see a pattern yet.

I was pretty sure the caller id info was updating on transfers, until
earlier.  I thought it may have had something to do with using the 7914 to
dial the extension I'm trying to transfer to, but that worked as well.
Right now, all transfers are working correctly.  I don't get it.  Ealier
they weren't.

I'm using the same methods of testing, same phones as before.

I was going live with this system this weekend, but I may put it off until I
can see a pattern.

Message-ID: <792897337FC81944BA4097ABD708977103F8D73F@pdc.bnsnet.co.uk>

Hi All,

I have noticed that Cisco retailers (in the UK) are now listing 7945G,
7965G, 7962G, 7942G & 7975G's phones. I must say the 7945G looks pretty
cool with the 7970 style display. 

Will these be supported by a later version of chan_sccp at all? Or will
someone need a CCM/E and these phones to see if anything has changed
protocol wise?

I assume (maybe wrongly) they are in the same family as the 7941,61,71?
Feature wise they look the same as the early prefixed models they
replace bar the physical update to the button layout and the colour
screens on some.

Regards,

What do you mean by internal ringing cadences?  If you mean setting the
ringer= to inside, outside, feature, silent, or urgent, that seems to work
for me with Asterisk 1.4 and the last version of chan_sccp posted to the
list using 7961's.  I have not tried the 7960's yet, though.

Hi Lacy,

yes, I mean the ringer=inside et al. settings. Luckily they do work  
-- I was in error, although I haven't tested them thoroughly yet. The  
problem I perceived was me writing `internal' instead of `inside'.

Regards,
-David.

Hi Steve,

I'd be very keen to try as soon as the first cheap offers appear on  
eBay ;-)

But seriously, I'd assume that a lot will work fine except some minor  
adjustments. And yes, we may need a CCM/E to fix these. Got one  
running somewhere?

By the way I doubt that the new phones are a lot better than the 7970  
series -- I actually don't like the buttons to get more cluttered and  
thus fragile as it could be with the new 5-way switch.

Apropos -- did any of you find a sensible application for the  
horizontal directions of the 7970's 4-way switch? I only did so in  
choosing the background image. On the other hand, it would be quite  
decadent to add a 4-way switch just for that.

-David.

Hi Patrick,

I'm not sure. I'd suggest you digg the archives for it. I didn't find  
a corresponding patch like that and would also be curious about its  
purpose.

Anyways, who sent this patch?

It appears the first call placed after Asterisk starts (not from a restart
now, but from a service asterisk restart or a full reboot of the system)
does not transfer the caller id information from an outside call (on a
transferred call).  It shows the caller ID of the caller who iniated the
transfer.  However, the rest of the calls show the caller id on transfers.

The protocol is the same so they should work as expected

the chan_sccp channel driver doesn't know the new phone model code so it 
would be nice to have a packet cap of the phone registration to the 
asterisk/sccp server

Using the latest chan_sccp for 1.4, and the Direct to Voicemail button is
gone.  There is a DirTrfr button that doesn't appear to do anything.  Am I
missng something here?  So far, this version looks good.  I had a crash once
during a transfer as soon as the system started, but other than that things
are looking real good.

Dear list members,

Latest chan_sccp - I nearly lost my biggest customer yesterday over phone system reliability problems. I would be very grateful to know when it will be possible to download the latest chan_sccp for Asterisk 1.4 complete with any known good patches - it really is critical that I can move forward in the next two weeks. I know that some versions have been attached to previous postings, but I am not really confident of applying patches. What reason (perhaps only time) that the current tree can not be released?

Phone firmware versions - Any chance we can get agreement on the best firmware versions for the various models?

DST/locale settings - Can anyone explain what files are needed to correctly localise Cisco phone 7940/7941/7960/7961 etc. During UK DST time all my 7940/7960 phones showed the correct time and my 7961 phone was 1 hour out. Now that DST has ended, all my 7940/7960s are 1 hour out and 7961 is correct! I would like my 7961 to show the date in UK format eg. d/m/y as my 7940/7960 already do (taken from sccp.conf). I know that there was a change in the way locale settings are used between 7940/7960 series and 7941/7961 series. I have access to Cisco downloads.

Caller id when transferring calls - I have also noticed that incoming caller id is lost when a call is transferred (assisted transfer). My users would expect to see the details of the original caller after the incoming call has been connected. I always thought that this was one of the benefits of the sccp that the PBX can re-write the display as necessary and thus change the info displayed?

Cisco router with CME 4 available - I am happy to donate a Cisco 1721 router complete with CME 4 to anyone who can really use it to further the cause of integration. This does list models 7941/7961 etc. I am happy to send this via courier to anywhere in Europe. I purchased this to debug how the lights on 7914s are controlled to allow more functionality in chan_sccp, but will propbably never get the time to do this.

UK PRI/ISDN30 settings - Is there anyone else in the UK using Digium E1 cards with PRI/ISDN30 lines? I have had a recent issue with one customer where customers ringing in were getting a busy signal and yet Asterisk/Zaptel showed no issues. I guess I need to debug PRI stuff, but this is fairly complex. I would be interested to know what settings anyone else uses for:

Timing source (I'm sure BT told me that the exchange should always provide the timing source)
Reset B channels: On or Off
Distance from NTE
Echo settings

Many thanks.

Martin

Well, of course it bails down to time. However, Marcello and I have  
agreed that our initial release shall compile with both asterisk 1.2  
and 1.4 so that future patches will only have to be applied against  
one tree. Apart from that we're ready for a release.

Beyond that we're still waiting for input by all the other commited  
people who have created other versions of chan_sccp, especially those  
working with asterisk 1.4. As we created a fork of the berlios  
chan_sccp to bring this work forward, we don't want it merely to be  
based on "our stuff" because we started it.

So on this occasion again: Please submit your patches or tell about  
your custom version of chan_sccp. We really with to re-unite all the  
useful however "stray" patches and pieces of code out there. I know  
how much work it is to actually identify the changes entered  
quick&dirty into one's own source tree, but it's definitely worth it.

Attached to this mail is the most recent version of Marcello's and  
mine joint work. I just added a feature that I had to unravel from my  
own legacy 1.2 tree: Using the global option "recorddigittimeoutchar  
= on", the '#' to terminate variable-length numbers as they commonly  
occur in European countries, is recorded to the call logs if it was  
dialed at first. So redialing works without manual post-dialing the #  
from the logs.

I have found that firmware version 7.2.2 works quite stable for the  
7940 and 7960. Although the 8.0.4 version seems to be stable too, I  
did not see a noticeable benefit in using this version. Please  
correct me if I missed an important issue.

Apart from that the most recent versions should be allright since we  
solved the directories issues. If you get any trouble nevertheless,  
just ask to the list what version is "known good" to the others members.

AFAIK the 7940/60s don't get the timezone information whatsoever.  
They just display the local time of the asterisk server, don't they?  
So you should check your server for that issue.

The 7941/61/70s all use the following settings for the timezone/ 
display issue:

     <dateTimeSetting>
         <name>CMLocal</name>
         <dateTemplate>D.M.Y</dateTemplate>
         <timeZone>W. Europe Standard/Daylight Time</timeZone>
     </dateTimeSetting>

Insert this just with a valid timezone string insted of W. Europe...  
before the <callManagerGroup> tag of your xml config. At the end of  
this mail I have compiled a list of valid timezone entries from the  
simplevoip wiki at http://voip-info.simplevoip.info/wiki/

Yes, but it also has to be implemented correctly, which was not so  
easy at the time Sergio had to do it. He commented on that issue just  
recently on the list. But I'm convinced that it's possible and not a  
great deal of work to get the feature working as you request it.

In fact, it would be very helpful to have such a router available to  
get forward with the newer protocol versions and more advanced  
features, which includes distinctive ringing, feature buttons,  
conference calls and shared lines. We have observed that minor things  
like the order of messages being sent can be important, which cannot  
always be guessed easily.

As Marcello and I currently don't have a CallManager at hand, and  
also lack IT administrator friends who occasionally might record a  
network trace, we could really use it to get on with the new  
features. We would be very grateful to accept your offer.

I'm not using any PRI cards, but I use bristuff's hfc zaptel drivers  
connected to bri ISDN PSTN. If the E1 card is the only device  
connected to the PRI trunk, which seems like the only common  
configuration one would use, I wouldn't expect such problems though.  
Are you sure the busy signal at the customer's site wasn't due to  
congestion of BT's network?

Hallo David,
hallo Martin,

we are very happy with the latest version. We added the transfer and the
group pickup fix and all our problems seem to disappear. 

Even if there are some minor issues I agree that this version of chan_sccp
is no longer a release candidate. It is a release!

Thanks a lot for this great work especially to David, Mardello and of course
the father of chan_sccp Sergio.

Have a nice day.

mine joint work. I just added a feature that I had to unravel from my  
own legacy 1.2 tree: Using the global option "recorddigittimeoutchar  
= on", the '#' to terminate variable-length numbers as they commonly  
occur in European countries, is recorded to the call logs if it was  
dialed at first. So redialing works without manual post-dialing the #  
from the logs.

Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] Two small patches and a new dialplan application
Message-ID: <4732DBAD.8040906@matflow.net>

Hi,

here are a two more patches, both adressing segfaults which are very
rare but still happen:

This one addresses gpickup again, I had one segfault with my previous
patch, this new one fixes that:

Then, I had one segfault when putting a call on hold which can be fixed
here:

I also added a new dialplan application called "SetMessage". It allows
you to send a message to the calling device. I use it to display call
forwarding to a device, because I could not use the native call
forwarding. The call forwarding here only acts on external calls, but
not on internal calls. However, the application can be used to display
other messages as well.

In the dialplan, simply use SetMessage(theMessage) to set a message, and
SetMessage() to remove the message.

This is the patch:

David,

Many thanks for your reply to my email.

If you give me your address, then I'll send off the router.

Latest version of chan_sccp - Are you saying that berlios has the latest version for
Asterisk 1.2 and your tree is the latest version for 1.4? I'm getting confused about
this. I appreciate that you want to have one tree for 1.2/1.4 which is a good thing, 
but I'll take your source as a 1.4 only solution at the moment. Which fixes do you
think are missing from your tree?

My contribution recently submitted was a fix for the 7960+7914 lost hangup event
after a re-dial/invalid extension, but it sounds like no one else has had this problem?

Can anyone recommend firmware versions for 7941/7961 (fairly hard to work out what the
version number is from the filenames!). As you say, there seems to be little point in using
the latest firmware unless you are actually working with Call Manager.

Timezones - My server's clock is on UTC/GMT and correctly changes the local time for DST.
As you say, I thought 7940/7960s just take the local time via sccp and also take the date
format from sccp messages. The 7941/7961/7970/7971 etc seem to pay more attention to the
config files. I'll try specifying the correct time zone in the config files as you suggest.

Regards,

Martin

We have a couple of 7941's and use 7941-7961 SCCP 7.0.3:

cnu41.2-7-6-26.sbn
CVM41.2-0-2-26.sbn
Jar41.2-9-2-26.sbn
TERM41.7-0-3-0S.loads
term41.default.loads
term61.default.loads

For all phones we use:

<dateTemplate>D.M.Y</dateTemplate>
<timeZone>W. Europe Standard/Daylight Time</timeZone>

The 7940's / 60's are fine for the 7941/70's they need this in
chan_sccp.conf:

tzoffset    = -1

To show the correct time :-)

I'm collecting all the patches and verifying the code and testing it on 
my phones.

I want to support the 1.2 branch too

So the updated tarball should be posted saturday or sunday

I was playing with hints on my 7970 this morning and it appears the LED
indicator does not work.

The display still shows the phone being picked up.

No issues on my 7961, still getting that friendly red indicator.

 

Anyone else have a 7970 with this problem?

Hi Paul,

I'd like to try that firmware version of yours to verify if it's  
really the firmware which causes the problems with the hints. I also  
have another issue that all newer firmware releases for the 7970  
cause the loading of png images to take very long.

Maybe you could send me your firmware image for testing.

Regards,
-David.

Hi all,

finally we have a release of chan-sccp-b which compiles out-of-the- 
box on both Asterisk 1.4 and 1.2 - you just have to type make to do  
so. There is not much of an updated documentation yet, so don't  
hesitate to ask here in the first place if you've got any questions  
as to the new features (which you probably are already using ;-).

Please check our project site on sourceforge to download it:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/chan-sccp-b/

We will soon move our codebase to the sourceforge svn server so you  
can stay even more up-to-date with what we're doing or even checkin  
some changes yourself. Please let us know if you'd like to be added  
as a project developer.

In the meantime we hope you enjoy this first "real" release and are  
anxious for feedback if it worked for you.

Regards,
-David.

Excellent news indeed. Thanks to all involved for this new release and
your continued efforts! I'll update my chan_sccp tomorrow and will let
you know how it goes.

I tend to fall into the if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  But I'm only using Asterisk at home so I'm not a good test case anyway.  But your release has given me a reason to play with things again ;)  I'll setup Asterisk in vmware and give it a try with my meager setup and both versions of Asterisk.

  I have access to 7911, 7936, 7940/60 and 7941/61-G-GE phones.  If you would like me to do any testing or packet captures let me know.  They are brand new and I'll be installing them with a CallManager 6 Business Edition server.  But I can test with my home * system too.

-Patrick

Hi,

Here my first findings compiling/running on
*1.2.14-BRIstuffed-0.3.0-PRE-1y:
- create_config.sh included in the tar.gz is not executable
- the tar.gz contains config.h so create_config.sh does not do anything
- On line 49 of create_config.sh $REALTIME_USEABLE=0 should be
REALTIME_USEABLE=0
- I see the pickup patch from Frank Segtrop is applied, but group pickup
still crashes my * :-(
As soon as I solved my bt problem I'll send a full bt.

The testing continuous ;-)

Steven.

Hi Steve,

thanks for the fast and useful feedback. Indeed some issues we shall  
resolve very shortly, hopefully then already with a solution for your  
GPickup crash. So please send a lot of  backtraces ;-)

But seriously, it's all the great feedback from you all on these  
lists which finally made this release possible. And we hope that  
there will be even more feedback now that there is an "official"  
release.

Regards,
-David.

As soon as I pick up the receiver on my 7970 asterisk crashes.
My 7970 also seems to crash and reboot itself too.
You jerks destroyed my network!
Jokes :)

I shall do some debugging and reporting when I'm a little less tired.

Hi Steven,


i've had the same problems like you at beginning of my tests. As my solution, see attached patch for
create_config.sh

My steps are:
- make clean
-- will delete config.h
- make
- make install

Note: create_config.sh needs not to be executable, because it is called in makefile per
sh ./create_config.sh

I will test the release over the next days and send an extra report on this list.

Sebastian

Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] Has the fix for re-dial/invalid number been
 incorporated into chan_sccp-b?
Message-ID: <28743023.91195034316975.JavaMail.root@mail.linkdc.co.uk>

Dear David,

Once again my biggest customer's system has crashed caused by an invalid number situation on the Cisco wireless handset. I do remember reading that someone on this list had solved these problems by not allowing a line/channel to be set to a invalid number/re-dial status. Do you remember incorporating any patch that deals with this?

Regards,

Martin

Hi Martin,

yes, we included the patch dealing with the invalid number condition,  
and I can't remember any problems related to it to occuring since then.

In the meantime, I also received the router and just started to make  
myself familiar with it. Many thanks again for that generous  
donation, and hopefully we will soon be able to resolve the remaining  
(protocol based) issues with its help.

By the way -- does the installed CME 4 support meetme conferences?  
Marcello and I would like to have a look at those in the near future.

But now, to the end of debugging, it would also be very if you could  
run asterisk from gdb and reproduce the problem.

This is done as follows:

1. Shut down your asterisk task
2. Run asterisk in gdb:

gdb asterisk
(gdb) set args -vf
(gdb) run
Starting program: /usr/sbin/asterisk -vf

....
Asterisk crashes
...

(gdb) bt

Then, please mail the backtrace that follows as well as the firmware  
version you're running on your phone.

I post this procedure once more to both lists even though you and  
many others may be familiar with it. However, there had been some  
requests as how to do these traces, so I think it might be helpful.

Regards and many thanks again,
-David.

Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] Possible to dial user@domain addresses?
Message-ID: <1195063241.11697.7.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi,

I have lightly used the 20071111 release with asterisk 1.4.13 and so far
everything seems to work well :)

About my question:

A SIP call from for example foo at bar.org comes into my asterisk server
and is forwarded to the 7961G running SCCP firmware:

sip call -> asterisk -> 7961G/SCCP

On the asterisk server I set the CALLERID(num) to foo at bar.org before
forwarding the call to the 7961G. On the 7961G it shows foo at bar.org in
the display when the call comes in and it also shows up as the number in
the missed/received calls menus.

Now if want to call back to that address, I go to the missed or received
calls menu, select it and press dial. This does not work.

Is it possible to make this work?

Thanks and regards,
Patrick

Did anyone test the channel driver to it maximum hole?

 

Or is there any could automate a test like this?

 

What I'm doing is to determine if the chan_sccp is stable or more stable
then SIP.

 

 

 


Thanks,

Hi
    Well I installed the new sccp driver.First thing I found (minor) was 
that in chan_sccp.c line 224 there needs to be an else if statement instead 
of an if statement. The if began on line 222. That fixed the inside ringer 
problem. Then all was good until I tried to transfer to anther phone (blind 
transfer). It killed asterisk, sent all of my sip phones (gxp2000 horrible 
phones) into some kind of loop. I had to reboot everything but the 7960 
never came back up.

My build was
    make clean
    make
    make install

    I noticed there is a patch directory. I know this is a stupid question, 
but just to be safe. Do I need to apply those patch's or are they just there 
to show what has already been applied.

As I get more info on the crash I will post it.

Thanks

Kelly

Thank you very much! I was desperately looking for a fix to that.

Well, there really seems to be a problem with transfer. I think the  
merge must have messed something up, we shall urgently work at this.

Hmm, this doesn't sound good. Have you pulled the power yet? I hope  
your phone starts working again...

Not a stupid question at all. This directory contains patches Sergio  
originally supplied with his releases. I gues Marcello just kept it  
when he created the archive for the release.

Message-ID: <DA60F019-D38F-4162-903C-C4879AD7C95C@davidded.de>

Hi,

Marcello just migrated our development tree to our Sourceforge  
project repository. Feel free to check out the latest changes we made  
to chan-sccp-b but please beware that there may at any time be  
untested or unstable code inside the repository.

https://chan-sccp-b.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/chan-sccp-b

We just added the "select" feature tonight to mark calls for later  
joining or unattended transfer. You can already select calls (a nice  
checkmark appears next to them), but that's it for now. We still need  
to fix unselecting calls as they are hung up, but apart from that  
everything's working nicely.

See you,
-David.

Message-ID: <F3F77C7BD63C8C488186EE2E5BC51106684C66@lhu01.llg.de>

Hi,

we recognize a little bug. If you get a second telephone call and you pickup
the phone without choosing which call you would like to answer, the newest
one is taken. We think it would make sense that the oldest one is taken at
first. Of course you can toggle between both calls. But in the daily work
you forget to do so.

Maybe this can be fixed quite easily, if all agree to the strategy first in
first taken.

Have a nice day.

Hi,

it's not a bug, it's a missing feature ;-)

I added your issue as a feature request on our sourceforge tracker. It  
may be easy to fix, but I'll have to take a look at the code first.  
I'll keep you apprised.

Hi,

an inevitable issue we're running into lately is related to fact that  
we now have two different mailing lists on the same topic.
In time we will most certainly start losing feedback if we only post  
to one list, on the other hand posts to both lists can be annoying or  
even distracting for those people who subscribed to both.

To make life easier for all of us, I'd suggest that everybody on the  
berlios list who is somehow to participate in development or  
deployment of the _new_ chan-sccp-b driver should join the sourceforge  
list and post messages regarding that project only to that list.

Please don't get me wrong: I do not seek to discourage use of the  
berlios list at all. However, people who recently learned about chan- 
sccp-b on Sourceforge should also have a chance to participate in the  
development discussions.

Kind regards,
-David.

Hi David,

I personally don?t like the sourceforge mailinglists. The mails from
sourceforge are split in 4 different files on our system. I guess this has
something to do with incompatibility of sourceforge and postfix/Exchange.

If all of us should move to sourceforge, then Sergio should cancel the
mailing list on Berlios.

Hi Russ,

this looks strange to me. I'm not sure what causes it. Could you maybe  
get me a bit more log output by typing "sccp debug 10" in the console  
and then try to register again?

Unfortunately I haven't such a phone at hand to try as well. I  
remember, however, Marcus thinking about getting one himself. What  
about it, Marcus?

Regards,
-David.

Hi,

Unfortunately the higher SCCP debug level didn't real yield more
information. Here is what repeats now:

[Nov 29 08:54:12]     -- SCCP: Accepted connection from 12.199.xxx.xxx
[Nov 29 08:54:12]     -- SCCP: Using ip 205.167.xxx.xxx
[Nov 29 08:54:14] WARNING[4433]: sccp_socket.c:54 sccp_read_data: SCCP:
read() returned Bad address
[Nov 29 08:54:14]     -- SCCP: Old session marked down
[Nov 29 08:54:14]     -- SCCP: Killing Session 12.199.xxx.xxx

This happens with a network that is P/NAT'd and one that isn't so it's
not a problem with that. I can't find any documentation that leads to a
solution either. I've checked the source code of sccp_socket.c where the
error resides, but the error description and the reason for it are
pretty cryptic to me.

It seems like this must be something simple but so far I'm stuck.

Regards,
Russ

Hi,

With the help of a good friend, I managed to get past the problem. It
turns out that because I'm using a 64-bit machine for my Asterisk
server, there is a bug in the code in sccp_socket.c. I have submitted a
patch via the SourceForge bug tracker for this issue. Now the phone
registers fine and I can make and receive calls, however I am dealing
with a one-way audio problem.  The 7921G sends audio but will not
receive, no matter which way the call was initiated.

Regards,
Russ

Is the 7921 behind NAT by chance?

Hi,

At this particular moment, it is behind NAT, yes.

Russ

That is what's causing your Audio RX issue.

Not all NAT implementations break SCCP, but many do.  For instance, a 
generic linux-based router will break it, but loading DD-WRT (linux based) 
on a linksys router will work properly with it.

Set your 7921 in the DMZ if you can, then try it.  I bet it works!
