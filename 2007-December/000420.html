I'm sorry to hear that. I'm using Asterisk 1.4 (latest svn) with
chan-sccp-b 20071111 on a CentOS 5.1 box and Cisco 7961s with factory
default skinny firmware and have not seen any crashes. Don't think I
ever tried assisted transfers so can not comment on that functionality
and thus of little use to you. Without any more info about your setup
it's difficult to make suggestions (unless you already did that off
course). Have you thought about hiring one of the core developers to
sort out the problems?

&gt;<i>  Having primed the end users for some months that a new version was

While I'm a happy user of chan-sccp-b and appreciate the hard work of
the chan-sccp-b community very much I also acknowledge the fact that
Cisco's Skinny implementation is rather proprietary which makes it quite
difficult to make this driver work 100% with Cisco phones. Therefor I
understand your decision to move to Polycom which uses standards based
SIP and is much more focused on making their products work well with PBX
vendors including Digium than Cisco will ever be.

&gt;<i>  Having stuck to my guns over Cisco handsets and native protocol over

</I>&gt;<i> SIP and will not risk putting any more Cisco handsets in with native
</I>&gt;<i> protocol and will probably move to Polycom handsets entirely.
</I>
You sure have hung in there for a long time given your problems. I also
use SIP phones and am quite happy with them. Hopefully your experience
will be the same.

&gt;<i>  I very much thank those who have contributed to the effort, but end

</I>&gt;<i>   long standing customers who I provide I.T. support for.
</I>
I hope that your switch to Polycom/SIP will work out for you and your
customer(s). The Polycom phones have a solid reputation in spite of a
rather steep configuration learning curve. Prepare to spend some time to
get the provisioning sorted out. Make sure you get the Polycom phones
from an official Polycom distributor/reseller that can provide you with
the latest firmware. FWIW I prefer the IP430 and IP650 because of the
backlit screens.

Best of luck!

Regards,
Patrick
