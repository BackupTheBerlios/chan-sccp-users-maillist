<PRE>Dear list members,

I recently tried to move to Asterisk 1.4.x with the latest chan-sccp-b on a system running a mixture of 7940s, 7960s and 7961+7914s and immediately the system crashed when testing assisted transfers. Having primed the end users for some months that a new version was going to solve the crashes every few days, it was a great disappointment and I had to roll back. The decision has now been made to abandon sccp and move to SIP and the Cisco 7961+7914s will be replaced by Polycom IP601s and side cars. Having stuck to my guns over Cisco handsets and native protocol over the last 1.5 years, I have now made the personal decision to move to SIP and will not risk putting any more Cisco handsets in with native protocol and will probably move to Polycom handsets entirely. I very much thank those who have contributed to the effort, but end users will simply not accept that a PBX should have the same reliable as their PCs, and the problems over the last year have damaged my reputation with long standing customers who I provide I.T. support for.

Good luck and best regards,

Martin Sutherland
