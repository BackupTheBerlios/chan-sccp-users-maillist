<PRE>Martin,

I run several Asterisk boxes, at work, at home and for various friends 
and family.

We love Cisco handsets but use them in SIP mode, with SIP firmware, and 
have 7905s, 7912s, 7940s, 7960s and 7970s all working well with Asterisk 
without any crashes!  The user interface changes a little to that of the 
SCCP phones, but everything &quot;just works&quot; as long as you are careful and 
select the right versions of SIP firmware (not necessarily the latest 
because Cisco keep twiddling things to work with CCM 5.x)

I recommend that you save your investment in what are high quality 
phones and change out the firmware to SIP.  If you want to drop me a 
line off list then I can provide more details.



Regards



Mike Tubby

</I>&gt;<i> I recently tried to move to Asterisk 1.4.x with the latest chan-sccp-b on a system running a mixture of 7940s, 7960s and 7961+7914s and immediately the system crashed when testing assisted transfers. Having primed the end users for some months that a new version was going to solve the crashes every few days, it was a great disappointment and I had to roll back. The decision has now been made to abandon sccp and move to SIP and the Cisco 7961+7914s will be replaced by Polycom IP601s and side cars. Having stuck to my guns over Cisco handsets and native protocol over the last 1.5 years, I have now made the personal decision to move to SIP and will not risk putting any more Cisco handsets in with native protocol and will probably move to Polycom handsets entirely. I very much thank those who have contributed to the effort, but end users will simply not accept that a PBX should have the same reliable as their PCs, and the problems over the last year have damaged my reputation with

</I>&gt;<i> Good luck and best regards,
