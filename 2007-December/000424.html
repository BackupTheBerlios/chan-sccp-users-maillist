I'm very sad to hear that. This is especially because Marcello and I  
didn't experience any further crashes related to transfers any more,  
and we hoped that the current release would be a solid base for most  
people.

Furthermore, I feel particularly sorry for your situation as you made  
that generous donation to the both of us. In connection to this, it  
shall be noted that you thus made possible many of the improvements  
and new fixed that we lately did. Although we could get on with quite  
some compatiblity issues and new features, the implementation and  
debugging is always another issue.

As Asterisk makes vast use of multithreading, debugging becomes a  
really formidable task, and it will always be. This is where only  
extensive debugging and the effort of many together trying to find the  
issues in various scenarious will be able to help; Ideally, running a  
production system with gdb on a very fast machine.

</I>&gt;<i> handsets in with native protocol and will probably move to Polycom  
</I>&gt;<i> handsets entirely. I very much thank those who have contributed to

</I>
I can very well understand your decision, and I'd also suggest you  
that course of action if your customers have a very high load and  
can't live with occasional crashes. Although the stability may be  
quite well in the light of the high load, it may simply not be  
sufficient for your customers, so you need solutions where you can  
blame the manufacturer, also in terms of liability. Obviously chan- 
sccp-b can't provide sufficient stability right now, so you need to  
look for alternatives. As polycom officially supports asterisk, this  
should be your choice.

Finally, this should remember all of us that we still have a long way  
to go. Yet, there's already so much to find along that way that we  
should pursue it further.


Best regards and all the best,
-David
