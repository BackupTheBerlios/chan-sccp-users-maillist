<PRE>I've got some problems on transfers too, expecially in mixed environments
SCCP/SIP/IAX.

I didn't recognize the problem at the moment. I looked onto every log but 
atm
nothing.

If anyone could suggest me something for debug, the help will be 
appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Federico

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> immediately the system crashed when testing assisted transfers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Having primed the end users for some months that a new version was

</I>&gt;<i> I'm very sad to hear that. This is especially because Marcello and I

</I>&gt;<i> and we hoped that the current release would be a solid base for most
</I>&gt;<i> people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, I feel particularly sorry for your situation as you made
</I>&gt;<i> that generous donation to the both of us. In connection to this, it
</I>&gt;<i> shall be noted that you thus made possible many of the improvements
</I>&gt;<i> and new fixed that we lately did. Although we could get on with quite
</I>&gt;<i> some compatiblity issues and new features, the implementation and
</I>&gt;<i> debugging is always another issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Asterisk makes vast use of multithreading, debugging becomes a
</I>&gt;<i> really formidable task, and it will always be. This is where only
</I>&gt;<i> extensive debugging and the effort of many together trying to find the
</I>&gt;<i> issues in various scenarious will be able to help; Ideally, running a
</I>&gt;<i> production system with gdb on a very fast machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The decision has now been made to abandon sccp and move to SIP and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Cisco 7961+7914s will be replaced by Polycom IP601s and side
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cars. Having stuck to my guns over Cisco handsets and native
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protocol over the last 1.5 years, I have now made the personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision to move to SIP and will not risk putting any more Cisco
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handsets in with native protocol and will probably move to Polycom
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handsets entirely. I very much thank those who have contributed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the effort, but end users will simply not accept that a PBX should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have the same reliable as their PCs, and the problems over the last
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> year have damaged my reputation with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  long standing customers who I provide I.T. support for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can very well understand your decision, and I'd also suggest you
</I>&gt;<i> that course of action if your customers have a very high load and
</I>&gt;<i> can't live with occasional crashes. Although the stability may be
</I>&gt;<i> quite well in the light of the high load, it may simply not be
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient for your customers, so you need solutions where you can
</I>&gt;<i> blame the manufacturer, also in terms of liability. Obviously chan-
</I>&gt;<i> sccp-b can't provide sufficient stability right now, so you need to
</I>&gt;<i> look for alternatives. As polycom officially supports asterisk, this
</I>&gt;<i> should be your choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, this should remember all of us that we still have a long way
</I>&gt;<i> to go. Yet, there's already so much to find along that way that we
</I>&gt;<i> should pursue it further.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards and all the best,
</I>&gt;<i> -David
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good luck and best regards,
