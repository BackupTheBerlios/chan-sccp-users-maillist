Subject: [Chan-sccp-users] video support for cisco video advantage
Message-ID: <e4792abb0903012242o47ccaa46ma721f74fc0550f2d@mail.gmail.com>

hi , i have sent this mail to the chan-sccp-discussion,
im actually a bit confused as to where i might help for my issue, so
im sending it here too.
i have downloaded the branch v2 version, and am able to make audio calls,
have tested with 2 ip communicators and one 7945,
i also have cisco video advantage,
i was hoping to get the video working, but there seems to be no video
support in sccp.conf like in sip .conf.
is this a missing feature or am i doing something wrong.

Thanx and regd's.

Allan.

Hello Allan,

video support is not yet ready. We should troubleshoot something before 
adding it.

Could you wait a while ?

Best regards

Federico

hi frederico,
thanx for your reply,
of course i could wait, also if needed i could troubleshoot.
but having it right now would have been just super
im no programmer, but if needed i could help out with other stuff,
docs etc. if you need anything tell me.

thanx again.
