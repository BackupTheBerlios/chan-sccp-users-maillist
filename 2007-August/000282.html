<PRE>Hi All,


I work for a company where we have cca. 100 Cisco 7940G phones running 
SIP.
Recently I was asked about using the original skinny firmware (what 
these phones has) with Asterisk to cut down the costs.
(For using SIP licences are needed.)

After installing Asterisk 1.4.10 (on Debian etch) and chan_sccp 
20060408 I was able to make and receive calls. (Also call parking 
worked fine.)
(I had to apply a patch on chan_sccp otherwise it couldn't compile.)


However it seems working I have a few questions:

- is there a newer version of chan_sccp?
- reload support?
- asterisk realtime support?
- which firmware version should be used on the phone? (I've tried 
v7-2-3 and v8-0-7)
- can chan_sccp be used in a production environment?

Currently reloading the sccp.conf is made by unloading and loading the 
chan_sccp.so. There are two problems with this:
- once the module is unloaded, the phones immediately loss the 
connection to asterisk. (New phones cannot be registered. 
transparently, which is not acceptable in a production environment.)
- sometimes when the module is unloaded asterisk crashes.


Thanks for the answers in advance.


Best regards,

	Gergely
