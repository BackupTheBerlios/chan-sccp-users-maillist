<PRE>Hi all!!

During the last few months i have seen some talks about patches, fixes and 
updates to chan-sccp(b). There was even some discussion about 
consolidating them, is there a version available anywhere that has all the 
fixes included?

I am still on Asterisk 1.2.24 and don't need any special features, just 
place and receive calls.

My current problem with chan-sccp is that i am using a Kirk Dect IP 600 
V2 with SCCP. The Kirk seems to work, i can register handsets to it and 
they can make outgoing calls. I am using the handsets at home, so i want 
to ring all handsets when a call comes in. Only 5 handsets ring, the 
other 6 stay silent, always the same handsets stay silent.

I believe my setup is different from most people on this list, because 
registration of all handsets (lines / devices) will come from one single 
ip address only.

Most people will use normal phones, and i guess not more than 1 - 3 
registrations per phone.

Can anyone confirm this problem?

Would i be better off using built in skinny now of Asterisk 1.2 or 1.4 or 
should chan-sccp still work for me?. There were some other messages of 
people on the list using the Kirk, but also with only a few handsets.

I assume that the issue in chan-sccp would be minor, if anyone would be 
willing to fix it for a reasonable fee i would also be interested in that.

Thanks all!!
Remco
