<PRE>Hi,

as Marcello and I already promised there will be a release of our  
current 1.4 chan_sccp tree soon. However, we are currently both short  
on time, and we also wish to take care of a few things:

- That as many as possible useful and robustifying patches around are  
included
- That the release should work using both 1.2 and 1.4 (requires some  
ifdef work)
- Some minor yet important issues have still to be tested.

The tests are best done _after_ releasing, but we would like to  
include all other stuff first, so that we don't get so many forks  
again, even in our own trees.

We believe that our 1.4 tree is quite stable and very complete in  
terms of features now. As there of course has been a lot work by  
other people as well, a discussion of the available trees and patches  
would be in order.

Therefore, I suggest that _everybody_ who has ever released a  
chan_sccp tree on this list or submitted a notable patch should write  
a report on that. This report should include all relevant information  
to ease the effort of merging.

To start off with our own work, I'd like to comment briefly what  
Marcello and I have done.

We have working support for * 1.4 (most work afaik by Marcello) as  
follows:
- It now includes fixes for newer firmware received calls issues, we  
also know that there is a locking problem, which I had discovered but  
not yet added to Marcello's main tree. It should crashes when hanging  
up in some cases.
- We also have full working support to add service url entries to  
speeddial buttons. This is directly calling any xml page like using  
the services menu by the push of a speeddial button.
- We have found out how to use 7914 buttons as busy lamp fields so  
that the busy party can still be called by pressing the new call key  
on the busy line callplane.
- Marcello has working asterisk realtime support and some other nice  
and handy features he might best announce himself.

What we have under development:
- I managed to find out how distinctive ringing (per line ringtones)  
works for the newer sccp protocol versions. Marcello has already  
implemented something for testing.
- I implemented a hack to append the # for terminating a variable- 
length number explicitly (neccessary for dialing in Germany) to the  
call history lists where applicable. Already works fine for a long  
time, but lacks a config option.
- There is sometimes an issue where the phone doesn't show the digits  
entered before the proceeding state. Still unclear when and why it  
occurs. Doesn't happen often though if ever.
- When using auto-answer in connection to the page() extension, I  
sometimes get crashes upon frequent dial/hangup conditions. Needs  
further investigation.

Below follow some comments on the original message. Just keep on  
looking down there.

Regards,
-David.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't even aware that this version existed. Is it for 1.2?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am about to try Asterisk 1.4 but simply don't know if all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes made in 20070620 are incorporated into the current Asterisk
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1.4 version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Neither do I. I have seen chan_sccp versions pop up on the forum at
</I>&gt;<i> www.ip-phone.de but I think those are for Asterisk 1.4.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have however had problems which all seem to stem from using 7914
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> side-cars. I have two 7960 phones with two 7914s each. For some  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the 7960s behave differently with 7914s attached. One real problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concerned having dial timeouts or invalid extensions. Either the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> phone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or chan_sccp does not detect the hangup message after the handset is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> put down after a redial tone (and the number dialled remains on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> display). When the phone is picked up again, the channel/line is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> active and nothing works. Re-setting the phone then caused  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Asterisk to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> die, presumably because a phone is registering but still has an  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> active
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel. Even worse, Asterisk doesn't actually exit, but is stuck in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory and requires a server re-boot to fix. I managed to patch my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version in the off-hook event to detect a channel/line in the redial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state and issue a on-hook message. The user just finds that nothing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happens and needs to on-hook and then off-hook again and saves an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Asterisk crash. Note that this problem  does not happen if the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 7914 is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disconnected!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there anyone else out there using 7914s with 7960s?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not me.
</I>
I have a number of 7914 and could easily manage to replicate your  
scenario. What firmware do you use? Btw, I didn't ever witness such a  
behaviour. But I definitely want to understand why that happens in  
your case.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I have 7940s, 7960s and one 7961 with different versions of sccp and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my protocol version on the server is still set to 3. Should this be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set to 4? What firmware is working best out there on 7960/7940 and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 7941/7961?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I use a couple of 7961 phones with factory default firmware, Asterisk
</I>&gt;<i> 1.2 and chan_sccp 20060408. I use the following fixes for this  
</I>&gt;<i> chan_sccp
</I>&gt;<i> release:
</I>&gt;<i> - chan_sccp-20060408-MeetMe_crash.patch
</I>&gt;<i> - chan_sccp-20060408-Gpickup_crash.patch
</I>&gt;<i> - chan_sccp-20060408-placed_calls.patch
</I>
The placed calls patch, was that mine, or from somebody else? Just  
curious as I'm not sure if I issued a patch for that or not.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My 7961 says it has the following firmware versions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> App Load ID:  Jar41.2-9-1-45.sbn
</I>&gt;<i> JVM Load ID:  CVM41.2-0-1-45.sbn
</I>&gt;<i> OS Load ID:   cnu41.2-7-5-50.sbn
</I>&gt;<i> Boot Load ID: 7961G_64-020704128Amd64meg.bin
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The limited functionality that I use work fine: Redial, DND, SendtoVM
</I>&gt;<i> and Transfer. Not sure if GPickup works since I don't use it. I've  
</I>&gt;<i> seen
</I>&gt;<i> requests in the past for the conference functionality which is  
</I>&gt;<i> absent in
</I>&gt;<i> this config. Would be nice if that were available in a chan_sccp  
</I>&gt;<i> version
</I>&gt;<i> for 1.2.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have recently purchased a used 1721 router with Call Manager  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Express
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loaded so that I can capture packets between the router and handset,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but understanding sccp packets is going to be tough for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can use Wireshark (or even tcpdump iirc) to capture the packets,
</I>&gt;<i> save them to a file and make the file available for download. This way
</I>&gt;<i> others who are interested in helping out can get easy access to this
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>
Absolutely. Wireshare also comes with a nice skinny parser module.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I look forward to any comments.
