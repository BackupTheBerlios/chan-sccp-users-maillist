<PRE>Hi Martin,

</I>
Definitely a good idea. +1!

&gt;<i>  The Asterisk 1.2 version that I have found the best is 20070620 which
</I>&gt;<i> was emailed to me by <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/chan-sccp-users">dmitry at makuha.kiev.ua</A> back in July. 
</I>
I wasn't even aware that this version existed. Is it for 1.2?

&gt;<i> I am about to try Asterisk 1.4 but simply don't know if all the
</I>&gt;<i> changes made in 20070620 are incorporated into the current Asterisk
</I>&gt;<i> 1.4 version.
</I>
Neither do I. I have seen chan_sccp versions pop up on the forum at
www.ip-phone.de but I think those are for Asterisk 1.4.

&gt;<i> I have however had problems which all seem to stem from using 7914
</I>&gt;<i> side-cars. I have two 7960 phones with two 7914s each. For some reason
</I>&gt;<i> the 7960s behave differently with 7914s attached. One real problem
</I>&gt;<i> concerned having dial timeouts or invalid extensions. Either the phone
</I>&gt;<i> or chan_sccp does not detect the hangup message after the handset is
</I>&gt;<i> put down after a redial tone (and the number dialled remains on the
</I>&gt;<i> display). When the phone is picked up again, the channel/line is still
</I>&gt;<i> active and nothing works. Re-setting the phone then caused Asterisk to
</I>&gt;<i> die, presumably because a phone is registering but still has an active
</I>&gt;<i> channel. Even worse, Asterisk doesn't actually exit, but is stuck in
</I>&gt;<i> memory and requires a server re-boot to fix. I managed to patch my
</I>&gt;<i> version in the off-hook event to detect a channel/line in the redial
</I>&gt;<i> state and issue a on-hook message. The user just finds that nothing
</I>&gt;<i> happens and needs to on-hook and then off-hook again and saves an
</I>&gt;<i> Asterisk crash. Note that this problem  does not happen if the 7914 is
</I>&gt;<i> disconnected!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there anyone else out there using 7914s with 7960s?
</I>
Not me.

&gt;<i>  I have 7940s, 7960s and one 7961 with different versions of sccp and
</I>&gt;<i> my protocol version on the server is still set to 3. Should this be
</I>&gt;<i> set to 4? What firmware is working best out there on 7960/7940 and
</I>&gt;<i> 7941/7961?
</I>
I use a couple of 7961 phones with factory default firmware, Asterisk
1.2 and chan_sccp 20060408. I use the following fixes for this chan_sccp
release:
- chan_sccp-20060408-MeetMe_crash.patch
- chan_sccp-20060408-Gpickup_crash.patch
- chan_sccp-20060408-placed_calls.patch

My 7961 says it has the following firmware versions:

App Load ID:  Jar41.2-9-1-45.sbn
JVM Load ID:  CVM41.2-0-1-45.sbn
OS Load ID:   cnu41.2-7-5-50.sbn
Boot Load ID: 7961G_64-020704128Amd64meg.bin

The limited functionality that I use work fine: Redial, DND, SendtoVM
and Transfer. Not sure if GPickup works since I don't use it. I've seen
requests in the past for the conference functionality which is absent in
this config. Would be nice if that were available in a chan_sccp version
for 1.2.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have recently purchased a used 1721 router with Call Manager Express
</I>&gt;<i> loaded so that I can capture packets between the router and handset,
</I>&gt;<i> but understanding sccp packets is going to be tough for me.
</I>
You can use Wireshark (or even tcpdump iirc) to capture the packets,
save them to a file and make the file available for download. This way
others who are interested in helping out can get easy access to this
information.

&gt;<i> I look forward to any comments.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Martin
</I>
Regards,
Patrick
