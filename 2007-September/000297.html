<PRE>Hello Martin,

&gt;<i> I know that there are several members out there kindly providing web
</I>&gt;<i> space for the latest chan_sccp, and amendments have been made here and
</I>&gt;<i> there. I am now very confused about which version contains the most
</I>&gt;<i> trusted fixes and what those fixes are. It would be fantastic if we
</I>&gt;<i> could all agree on which is the best version and have a definitive
</I>list
&gt;<i> of changes made since 20060408. The Asterisk 1.2 version that I have
</I>&gt;<i> found the best is 20070620 which was emailed to me by
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/chan-sccp-users">dmitry at makuha.kiev.ua</A> back in July. I am about to try Asterisk 1.4 but
</I>&gt;<i> simply don't know if all the changes made in 20070620 are incorporated
</I>&gt;<i> into the current Asterisk 1.4 version.
</I>
Do you have a list of fixes that 20070620 contains over the last version
in 2006? Do you find it stable under 1.2? I think that your right and a
mini FAQ or patch / fix list needs to appear somewhere. We have a 2006
build we have changed to suit our needs and it works very well. But I
assume people who know chan_sccp better than we do have probably fixed
or extended it properly :-)

But could you place that sccp version somewhere? url?
 
&gt;<i> I have however had problems which all seem to stem from using 7914
</I>&gt;<i> side-cars. I have two 7960 phones with two 7914s each. For some reason
</I>&gt;<i> the 7960s behave differently with 7914s attached. One real problem
</I>&gt;<i> concerned having dial timeouts or invalid extensions. Either the phone
</I>&gt;<i> or chan_sccp does not detect the hangup message after the handset is
</I>&gt;<i> put down after a redial tone (and the number dialled remains on the
</I>&gt;<i> display). When the phone is picked up again, the channel/line is still
</I>&gt;<i> active and nothing works. Re-setting the phone then caused Asterisk to
</I>&gt;<i> die, presumably because a phone is registering but still has an active
</I>&gt;<i> channel. Even worse, Asterisk doesn't actually exit, but is stuck in
</I>&gt;<i> memory and requires a server re-boot to fix. I managed to patch my
</I>&gt;<i> version in the off-hook event to detect a channel/line in the redial
</I>&gt;<i> state and issue a on-hook message. The user just finds that nothing
</I>&gt;<i> happens and needs to on-hook and then off-hook again and saves an
</I>&gt;<i> Asterisk crash. Note that this problem  does not happen if the 7914 is
</I>&gt;<i> disconnected!
</I>
We found that the firmware used for the 7960 and 7914 make a huge
difference to its performance.

We use P00307020300 for the 7940/60s and S00105000200 for the 7914s and
do not have any of the issues you are describing. Maybe trying that
firmware with your current config should solve the issues. I asked here
and someone recommended those versions to me for our setup and it is
very stable. 

So I am just passing on what they say :-) YMMV
 
Regards,

Steve
